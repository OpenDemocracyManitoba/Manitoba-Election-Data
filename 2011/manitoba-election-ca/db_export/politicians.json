      "questionnaire": "**Why did you decide to run in the 2011 Manitoba election?**\r\n \r\nMy three kids inspire me to create a wonderful home province full of opportunity for their futures. I believe that our education system needs to be adjusted so that all children can shine at their best and brightest with no limitations but their own.  I am also a chronic illness patient that had to deal with a roller coaster ride through the health care system and I would like to be hands on in bringing change to the system for all patients that need access to doctors, treatments, home care and medications.\r\n \r\n**What experience will you bring to compliment your role as MLA?**\r\n \r\nMy background is in Project Management. I’ve been with The Kellan Group since May 2000 and worked from an administrative position to my current position of Chief Learning Officer. I’m not afraid of hard work and know the keys to making any project a success from painting a bathroom to a full computer system upgrade of over 11,000 terminals. My experiences in the health care system from 2006 – 2008 gave me a passion to act for change. I’m also an advocate for The Arthritis Society and from that I’ve learned that political stripes don’t matter when it comes to a common goal.\r\n \r\n**Is there anything in particular you would like to change in our province?**\r\n \r\nI’d love to see more access to farmer’s markets in the province. With my disease I have learned the value in health living and I would like to make it easier for everyone in Manitoba to have access to the basics of good nutrition which would help us in lower health care costs overall. I’d also like to look at helping the education support the needs of all the students in the schools of Manitoba.\r\n \r\n**In your electoral division?**\r\n \r\nI’d love to help create more community support funding so that all community clubs are able to have programs, upgrades, staff and other resources they need to run their programs and to keep sport accessible to all youth in the community. I firmly believe that community clubs in the city matter and would commit to helping them continue and improve their valuable services.\r\n \r\n**What is one thing you stand for that is not a part of your political party's platform?**\r\n \r\nI’d like to see more medical research and clinical trial options become available for chronic illness patients. Patients of sound mind should be allowed to be active partners in their treatments and be given all the options so they can be pro-active in their own care.\r\n \r\n**Do you have any other comments regarding your candidacy?**\r\n \r\nI consider this experience to be one of several thousand job interviews put into a 4 week time span. I am hoping that folks will take a minute to listen to what I have to say and when they go to vote they will put their faith in me by hiring me to represent them. I can think of no job in the world as important as being in public office. This has been a life changing learning experience and also very life affirming as well. I’ve been honoured to be the Liberal option for Radisson voters and hope that I can be there for them in years to come.\r\n \r\n**What is your favourite location in the electoral division you are currently a candidate for?**\r\n \r\nMy home in Windsor Park. It is where my heart is along with my family. My favourite moments often come from enjoying a meal with my family around our dinner table at night.",

      "questionnaire": "**Why did you decide to run in the 2011 Manitoba election?**\r\n\r\nWe need real change and our People’s Agenda is the best way to fix Manitoba’s growing problems. We will create good-paying jobs, boost education, create social justice and save the environment. Our Agenda is completely different from the policies which got us into our present mess.\r\n\r\nThe Agenda will improve the lives of working people in all nations in Manitoba, Aboriginal or not. We are the only party that supports full Aboriginal rights, the starting point to win full justice. We have many ways to win full justice in our Agenda.\r\n\r\nPoverty is rising, spurred by the NDP’s corporate tax cuts, record profits and falling wages. Winnipeg’s food banks feed 29,500 children, up from 5,500 in 1997. Affordable, quality housing is still missing. We have not recovered from the loss of 12,000 manufacturing jobs in 2008, a rate higher than Ontario. In the last census, Manitoba has Canada’s highest drop-out rate, which means education must be a higher priority.\r\n\r\nWe are also running candidates to warn against the election of a Conservative government in Manitoba. The Tories would bring even more vicious measures for workers and the needy.  \r\n\r\n**What experience will you bring to compliment your role as MLA?**\r\n\r\nWhen I joined the Communist Party in 1978, it opened a window into Canada’s real history, how working people actually won medicare and unemployment insurance, or organized all the major unions. Our party played the leading role in all these great struggles, but we could not have done it alone.\r\n\r\nAfter 33 years of being part of the struggle, I know that our People’s Agenda matches or leads the most advanced positions of all the major popular organizations in this country, including the labour movement.\r\n\r\nI have long experience in the people’s movements of Canada. I was a delegate to the founding convention of the Canadian Federation of Students in 1980 in Winnipeg; I am the past chair and treasurer of the Canadian Peace Alliance, our largest anti-war coalition. I know what it takes to win real change, and am always working to make it happen, for a real People’s Agenda.\r\n\r\nFor me, Marxism and its irrefutable analysis of capitalism have made me understand the source of poverty, war, unemployment, national oppression, and discrimination and what is needed to solve these problems. \r\n\r\n**Is there anything in particular you would like to change in our province? In your electoral division?**\r\n\r\nManitoba is a low wage province because of a too-large pool of super-exploited labour – Aboriginal people, women, youth, people with disabilities, and newcomers especially. They are a source of super profits for the wealthy families. The colonial conditions of Aboriginal peoples is a festering sore on Manitoba’s soul and it is a strategic problem to fix, or working people will be unable to move ahead together.\r\n\r\nStronger, united labour and popular movements are needed in Manitoba to bring real change and a People’s Agenda. Voting for a People’s Agenda will help, yet the surest way to win it is more involvement by people in the political struggle.\r\n\r\nIn Point Douglas, the Communist Party would move the CPR tracks and create affordable, quality housing, recreation and parks. As Winnipeg’s poorest riding, Point Douglas especially needs a People’s Agenda. \r\n\r\n**What is one thing you stand for that is not a part of your political party’s platform?**\r\n\r\nMy concerns are covered by our platform. Manitoba needs real change in many areas. \r\n\r\n**Do you have any other comments regarding your candidacy?**\r\n\r\nIt makes me happy when I can meet my family’s needs and be involved in the life of my children and grandkids. I can only wish this on others and will work to build a society where families can meet every need for their children, and where children have a far brighter future without the threat or reality of hunger, nuclear war or global climate meltdown. We need to act now.\r\n\r\nAll around us global capitalism’s crisis is growing. It is not just war, job loss, poverty and hunger. Flooding in Manitoba will be worse unless we drop carbon emissions, yet there is not yet a scientific grasp of what policies will work. The NDP’s cap and trade system will make tons of money for corporations, solve nothing, and delay a real solution.\r\n\r\nFinally, labour-farmer unity can defeat the threat by the Harper Conservatives to destroy the Canadian Wheat Board if action is taken immediately. Manitoba’s Tories support Harper’s dictatorial plan which will place farmers at the mercy of the giant grain corporations that now dominate the international grain trade. The plan will ruin thousands of family farms and put profit ahead of the starving millions in other countries. \r\n\r\n**What is your favourite location in the electoral division you are currently a candidate for?**\r\n\r\nI like the old buildings worth saving and the care people put into their homes to grow wonderful gardens and special places. I like Selkirk Ave, which is still thrives here and there, but with too many pawn shops and fast money outlets. Joe Zuken Park is named after a prominent communist in Winnipeg. It is next to the site of the Vulcan Iron Works where the Winnipeg General Strike started, so those two spots are my favourite in the riding.",

      "questionnaire": "**Why did you decide to run in the 2011 Manitoba election?**\r\n\r\nOur policies would create a fairer society in Manitoba and the time is overdue to end poverty and injustice. We have policies that will work in the Communist Party’s People’s Agenda for Manitoba. We would create thousands of good-paying jobs with a 32 hour work week with no loss in pay and raise the minimum wage to $16.25 an hour. We will give jobs to everyone who wants one, and with all the added wealth we will end poverty. We support full Aboriginal rights, which is different from any other political party. The Communist Party has the best and only good plan to end the terrible conditions and racism experienced by Aboriginal people.  \r\n\r\n**What experience will you bring to compliment your role as MLA?**\r\n\r\nI am a father of four and an outside City worker for the last 18 years. I have always worked and learned about the need to stick and work together and about getting the job done. I have seen and experienced injustice, things that never should happen, and want to make sure we solve the problem for good. We have great ideas in our party for what should happen right now and we are always working to make them happen, including our long term goal of a socialist society. I will work with everyone to get the job done. \r\n\r\n**Is there anything in particular you would like to change in our province? In your electoral division?**\r\n\r\nThe main problem is the lack of good-paying jobs for young people and offering them a reason to stay in school, a chance at a better future and a family. We won’t have an economy unless students stay in school. Manitoba has the highest drop out rate in Canada, according to the last census. So instead of hiring expensive truant officers to give fines to poor families, the Communist Party will pay students or families to stay in school. We would start hot breakfast and lunch programs in every school for all students, because the number of children relying on food banks in Winnipeg has gone up 500% since 1997.\r\n\r\nIn Burrows, the Communist Party would move the CPR tracks north of the City and use the area for affordable, quality housing, recreation and a big park. This would make the North End a more equal part of Winnipeg, not being cut off by the tracks. We will help the City build affordable rapid transit from the North End. We also need more affordable, quality child care centres. \r\n\r\n**What is one thing you stand for that is not a part of your political party’s platform?**\r\n\r\nOur platform covers a lot and it fits together. It is really a People’s Agenda. I can’t find anything that is selfish or narrow to complain about. It even says that if we are elected we will refuse to accept an MLA salary that is more than the average worker’s wages and benefits. That sounds fair, and we are not in politics to make money for ourselves. \r\n\r\n**Do you have any other comments regarding your candidacy?**\r\n\r\nChange does not have to be slow to end poverty or create jobs, to improve education. It will happen a lot faster when more and more people demand jobs and education between elections. Instead of wage and corporate tax cuts, we need to get more people involved to put people first in Manitoba. \r\n\r\n**What is your favourite location in the electoral division you are currently a candidate for?**\r\n\r\nSelkirk Avenue. We need more parks and recreation centres.",

      "questionnaire": "**Why did you decide to run in the 2011 Manitoba election?**\r\n\r\nI am seeking re-election because in my 13 years in legislature, the need for improvement in our province has never been more vital. Manitoba deserves a strong, honest, determined leader in order to protect our future, the future of our children and that of our children’s children. I am committed to continue using my experience and work ethic as long as it will benefit the province. As a father and a pediatrician who has taught and researched at the University of Manitoba as well as looked after children with cancer, I have seen the problems in health care first-hand and I see a better way forward.  With a degree in economics and experience in the federal cabinet, I see how we can better manage the finances of our province to help facilitate job growth, and improve our industries in Manitoba.  With long-term experience in dealing with environmental issues, I see a better approach to environmental stewardship in our province. With elected experience at both the federal (4 years) and provincial (13 years) levels of government, I believe I have the background to make a difference for people in Manitoba.\r\n\r\n**What experience will you bring to compliment your role as MLA?**\r\n\r\nAlong with my 13 years of experience as a MLA for River Heights, I was a Member of Parliament for Portage-Interlake from 1993-1997. During this period I served in the federal cabinet as Minister of Science, Research, and Development as well as Minister of Western Economic Development. I played a major role in advancing the Information Highway and in policy initiatives like the Community Access program to help connect Canadians to the Internet. As Minister of Western Economic Development I strongly supported small businesses and entrepreneurs in Western Canada. I brought forward many initiatives to aid the Community Futures Development Program, including initiatives for Youth Entrepreneurs, for Entrepreneurs with Disabilities, and for mentoring and training business development officers. Additionally, I introduced various approaches to foster innovative businesses in the information technology, environmental technology, and biotechnology.\r\n\r\n**Is there anything in particular you would like to change in our province? In your electoral division?**\r\n\r\nI believe there is so much more that must be done in Manitoba to prepare our province for the future. This is why I am seeking re-election. Crime must to be addressed in our community so people feel safe. More programs for youth and seniors are required. Quality education (from early childhood education to post-secondary) is a priority. I believe we must focus on innovative solutions to health care in our province. Wait times for treatment continue to be a problem that I will work to address. Seniors need care so they can live a healthy and affordable lifestyle. They deserve to have more of a voice and be better taken care of whether they live in a personal care home or in their own home. Municipal issues related to infrastructure need to be addressed, as well as our roads demanding major improvements. A water management strategy needs to be put into place. I welcome the opportunity to work with individuals and groups to achieve benefits for all Manitobans.\r\n\r\n**What is one thing you stand for that is not a part of your political party's platform?**\r\n\r\nThe environmental issues are part of my party’s platform but possibly what the voters don’t know about me is that I deeply care about the environment and I continue to research and write about bald eagles and their habitat.\r\n\r\n**Do you have any other comments regarding your candidacy?**\r\n\r\nI have represented River Heights as the MLA in the legislature for 12 years.  During this time our Liberal presence in the Legislature, though small, has accomplished numerous victories in the form of improvements for Manitobans.   Legislation initiated by myself and Kevin Lamoureux which has passed includes The Apology Act, The Good Samaritan Act, Legislation to provide for 24 hour access to medical records in hospitals and personal care homes, Legislation to improve reporting of medical errors, legislation to facilitate organ donation and legislation to remove phosphorous from automatic dishwasher detergents. In addition, we have promoted many other measures to address poverty, Jordan’s Principle, to improve understanding, diagnosis, prevention, and help for those with FASD, and to improve health and wellness.\r\n\r\n**What is your favourite location in the electoral division you are currently a candidate for?**\r\n\r\nMy wife and I are River Heights residents and have lived here for many years. I love every part of my community, but one of my favourite things is the arching elm trees on our River Heights streets. I feel they embody the spirit of this wonderful neighbourhood.",

I was first elected in 2003 and it has been a privilege to represent local residents and serve the community.  It is the most rewarding and gratifying job anyone can ever have.\r\n\r\n**What experience will you bring to compliment your role as MLA?**\r\n\r\nBefore becoming MLA I was a social worker for the Child Guidance Centre, working with youth and families. My experience in helping others - through the buiding of strong and stable communities - it makes for healthy families. I am a strong believer that it takes a village to raise a child.\r\n\r\n**Is there anything in particular you would like to change in our province? In your electoral division?**\r\n\r\n  I believe that working to build community involvement is work that is never done. Community development is close to my heart and I really believe that many challenges that families must endure as part of life, can be made easier through local involvement in their communities.  When individuals come together to work together we can accomplish great things that benefit everyone.\r\n\r\n**What is one thing you stand for that is not a part of your political party's platform?**\r\n\r\nMy values are the same as my party, Today’s NDP. We share the same vision, we share the same values and the same philosophy -  that no one should be left behind and equality is for everyone.\r\n\r\n**Do you have any other comments regarding your candidacy?**\r\n\r\n I bring experience as a cabinet minister, as a social worker, mother and MLA to the job. I’ve worked hard all my life and will continue to work diligently for my constituents, to listen to their concerns and work with the community to build a safer, more prosperous society for all.\r\n\r\n**What is your favourite location in the electoral division you are currently a candidate for?**\r\n\r\n   Firstly I love  all areas of my constituency, but  since I have to choose one location, I would say, Kings Park , for peaceful walks with my dogs , while watching families enjoy  the beautiful scenery and a  fun day out together.",

The NDP is the party that will improve Manitobans’ quality of life, through better health care, education, infrastructure and public services.\n\n**What experience will you bring to compliment your role as MLA?**\n\n\nI am a lifelong resident of the constituency.  I know the communitys’ needs and have worked hard with many organizations to address them.  The Gimli constituency is diverse, from St. Andrews to Hecla Island. In the past eight years I have met with municipal governments, school board, recreation boards, service clubs and community groups to move infrastructure and community projects forward.\n\n**Is there anything in particular you would like to change in our province? In your electoral division?**\n\n\nThe health of Lake Winnipeg is a big issue.  We have made much progress to address this and have a longstanding commitment to return the lake to a healthy state.  The water levels are a concern and first the Schreyer government and our government this decade built dike infrastructure to protect residents from the fall storms.  Health care and education continue to be important priorities for me.  We continue to improve facilities and services in the Gimli constituency.\n\n",

      "questionnaire": "**Why did you decide to run in the 2011 Manitoba election?**\r\n\r\nThe election is an important time to reach the people of Minto with a different idea of what their government could be doing on their behalf. We believe our People’s Agenda policies address the real issues, such as jobs, education, improving society and saving the environment. For example, our goal is to have good-paying jobs for everyone able to work, with a 32 hour work week and no loss in pay. That would go a long way to end poverty. \r\n\r\n**What experience will you bring to compliment your role as MLA?**\r\n\r\nYears of working with people in a helping capacity and witnessing the lives of Manitoba families from a very close perspective especially when they are in difficult situations has been very significant in suggesting what families really need.  I have taught school up north and on reserve and in the inner city.  I worked in community development for Central Child and Family Services for over a decade. Seeing people rise to the challenges and face their problems when there are often inadequate resources makes me want to do more to change society rather than support band-aid solutions.  I have also raised my own family of 6 mostly alone and am watching them raise their own as well.  We know from experience life is not always easy no matter how hard you try.  Equality has to mean more than lip service. \r\n\r\n**Is there anything in particular you would like to change in our province? In your electoral division?**\r\n\r\nI have an extensive list. For Manitoba, such as working for full Aboriginal rights, because of the continuing colonial conditions. We need a new relationship of equality with all nations in Canada, and greater compensation for the genocide that has taken place such as with residential schools. We would also work to improve immigrant rights by recognizing education credentials, reducing the size of the large pool of low-wage workers in this province. We would reverse the public service wage cuts. Workers should not lose because of inflation. I already mentioned our goal for jobs and ending poverty, but using the added resources from full employment we would raise social assistance above the poverty line and launch a massive home building program.\r\n\r\n**What is one thing you stand for that is not a part of your political party's platform?**\r\n\r\nThe party platform is extensive and always evolving with new technology and understanding, but the basic principles are really about what works for human beings and the world they live in.  With that basis, most truly good ideas would make their way on to our platform.  I am not dwelling on being against things because I am fully convinced that when the agenda of jobs, education, housing, recreation and arts, transportation, and redistributing wealth is secured the negative problems will be all but gone and much easier to deal with.  A just and rewarding life is fully within our grasp if we want to have it for ourselves and our neighbours. \r\n\r\n**Do you have any other comments regarding your candidacy?**\r\n\r\nOur long term goal is socialism and I know more and more people understand we need it to make society much fairer. Our present system is based on greed, violence and exploitation. It cannot last. \r\n\r\nIn Minto, I believe we should be paying students or their families to stay in school, not hiring new truant officers who would end up criminalizing more youth in the core area. Poverty is a big problem in Minto and it’s connected to health, so we would expand universal health to cover eye, dental and drugs. We will raise the minimum wage to $16.25 an hour. Many of our policies deal with ending racism and sexism, such as with fair and mandatory hiring targets. Our tax policy would help home owners by removing education from property taxes; we need to base taxes more on ability to pay, so we would have a wealth and inheritance tax, hike taxes on higher earners and cut taxes for the working poor. \r\n\r\n**What is your favourite location in the electoral division you are currently a candidate for?**\r\n\r\nThe beauty of the Minto riding lies in the people themselves.  I love going door to door talking to the different people and hearing what’s going on in their lives or what’s currently on their minds.  Residents are justly proud and I am always thrilled with the gardens and what they can be coaxed to do. I am a big fan of the Arts and Crafts design movement of 100 years ago and we see a lot here.  I really am interested in what other people have done to keep their houses authentic. \r\n\r\nOur home parish for many years was St.Edward’s Church on Arlington which is a beautiful spiritual place.  My mother taught in the school and I taught Sunday school.  We had many good times there and I never pass by without the thought of my mom. \r\n\r\nBut the best place in the area has to be Jacob Penner Park.  That’s the place I fell in love with my partner Darrell when I heard him give a speech during the annual People’s Voice Picnic.  I will always feel close to this place named for the famous communist and the beginning of so many good things in my life.",

Too many times we see our current elected officials simply trying to one up the other or blame each other for failures of the past. We need new, fresh ideas and solutions that come from the grassroots to help ensure our children, grandchildren, great grandchildren and beyond have a great place that they can live, work and play.\r\n \r\nI can bring those ideas to the table by being a strong advocate for all residents of our constituency, city and province.\r\n \r\n**What experience will you bring to compliment your role as MLA?**\r\n \r\nI have an honours diploma in Computer Programming.\r\n\r\nI have worked in the finance, insurance, health care, electronic gaming, forestry, farming, construction, and retail sales fields of work.\r\n\r\nI have volunteered on numerous community boards and have in depth knowledge of many of the issues that impact our residents.\r\n \r\n **Is there anything in particular you would like to change in our province?**\r\n\r\nI believe the way our health care is currently being offered is out of date and the model needs to be looked at. It should be easier for patients to get access to family doctors, our reliance on walk in clinics needs to be reduced and the wait time to see specialists needs to be changed and monitored so that we don’t have people’s health getting even worse while they wait.\r\n\r\n**In your electoral division?**\r\n\r\nI would love to see a multi-use facility rise in the area that would have access for various indoor sports, community gatherings and the like. There is no facility even remotely close by that is available for our residents to use and having one that would go a long way to getting more people involved in the community.\r\n \r\n**What is one thing you stand for that is not a part of your political party's platform?** \r\n\r\nI believe that at all levels of the political process there should be a mechanism for the removal of an election official by the electorate between elections. I would like to see a recall process implemented that will allow this to happen.\r\n \r\n**Do you have any other comments regarding your candidacy?**\r\n \r\nMany people ask or say, isn't a vote for you a wasted vote? I say to them, the only wasted vote is when someone does not vote. The Green Party of Manitoba has 32 candidates, that is more then enough to form government. Take the time to actually consider the platforms presented to you, ignore the negative rhetoric generated only to confuse you and you will see that a vote for me is a vote for a stronger Manitoba for you, for your children, for your grand children and beyond.\r\n \r\n**What is your favourite location in the electoral division you are currently a candidate for?**\r\n\r\nI love going to the park(s) near Garden Grove school that I take my son to play at all the time and sitting in my front yard watching my son play and conversing with my neighbours as they walk by is fantastic.",

      "questionnaire": "**Why did you decide to run in the 2011 Manitoba election?**\r\n\r\nMy reasons for entering politics stem from a personal frustration with the existing government and its view of the North. We have been viewed as a “safe”  seat for many years, yet we have seen no real benefit from providing it with support. Even something as fundamental as the delivery of health care has been allowed to deteriorate, despite concerns being brought to the attention of the Minister of Health over a period of years. \r\n\r\n**What experience will you bring to compliment your role as MLA?**\r\n\r\nI have been involved in a variety of positions in both volunteer and other organizations. As a parent I understand the need to provide our children with the skills necessary to be accepted into a post-secondary institution or the work force.  As a professional geologist, I understand the upswings and downturns of the mining industry. Mining remains the foundation of our economy, and as your Flin Flon MLA I will promote both mining activity as well as economic diversification in our region.\r\n\r\n   I have demonstrated that I can act for the interests of the community. I organized and moderated the December 1 community health care form, and subsequently became chairman of the Concerned Citizens Health Care Committee in an effort to continue to apply pressure on the Provincial government and the Minister of Health to improve health care delivery. \r\n\r\n**Is there anything in particular you would like to change in our province? In your electoral division?**\r\n\r\n  Our biggest challenge will be to restore confidence in the health care system in our constituency and possibly the entire Province. During the December 1 public health care forum organized by myself, citizens voiced their concerns, including access to physicians, patient transportation, wait times, access to a new clinic and lack of communication by the NOR-MAN Regional Health Authority (NRHA). Many of these issues were identified in a report compiled by a minister-appointed Review Team.\r\n\r\n   To restore confidence there must be effective communication at all levels, between patients and staff and amongst all staff members. We should consider integration of all health services across the region. This is critical to ensure proper patient follow-up care. The NRHA needs to become fully accountable to the public for all of its activities.\r\n\r\n   In the Liberal platform other health related issues are also addressed. The emphasis is on detection and prevention. The proactive treatment of FASD, addictions and other chronic ailments would ultimately save tax dollars and improve the quality of life for its victims and for society as a whole.\r\n\r\n   Patient care has to be THE priority for all associated with the health care system. \r\n\r\n**What is one thing you stand for that is not a part of your political party's platform?**\r\n\r\nThe current government has tried to appear to be fair. Their actual record falls short for this constituency. The Pas and Thompson have received substantial funding for the expansion of their UCN campuses. Flin Flon got a mining academy. I would promote Flin Flon as more than a mining region.\r\n\r\n   Many programmes and initiatives devised by the current régime have a decidedly southern perspective and have limitations when applied to our Northern reality. For example, the Provincial recycling programme was mandated from Winnipeg with no consideration of our region. Our city now has to pay a significant amount of money to install a weigh scale, and will be charged $10/tonne by the Province for landfill waste. This is a not inconsiderable expenditure for our cash-strapped community. Our recycling centre needs improved facilities so collected materials can be efficiently processed.  \r\n\r\n**Do you have any other comments regarding your candidacy?**\r\n\r\nThe Flin Flon constituency needs a strong representative in the Legislature, one who will stand up for the needs of the North, one who understands the issues that affect ALL the residents of the region. The Liberal approach is the one that is most reasonable: address concerns and problems on a pro-active basis, not as a reaction to an emergency. This approach is the one that is most fiscally responsible and causes the least disruption to society. \r\n\r\n**What is your favourite location in the electoral division you are currently a candidate for?**\r\n\r\nThis would have to be Manistikwan Falls, not the easiest place to get to. It’s a lush, damp place with a profound and subtle beauty.",

      "questionnaire": "**Why did you decide to run in the 2011 Manitoba election?**\r\n \r\nThere are many reasons why I decided to run in this election. As a progressive-minded person who is quite disappointed with how the province has been run for the past several years, I think it is important to have an option other than a fiscally irresponsible government that runs more on rhetoric than on action or one that feels the need to make drastic cuts to essential services on ideological grounds. I think it is very important to bring environmental issues to the forefront of politics and to promote policies that will improve our education and health care systems and solve our violent crime problems effectively. With my background and experience I think that I would be the best person to accomplish this.  \r\n\r\n**What experience will you bring to compliment your role as MLA?**\r\n\r\nFor most of my adult life I have worked with many of Winnipeg’s least fortunate people, homeless suffering from mental illness, youth from broken homes. I see many of the biggest issues facing our province on a daily basis.\r\n\r\nAt the moment I sit on five volunteer Boards, some of which are very agreeable and some of which are quite contentious and I have helped all but one in developing an organizational strategy and corporate vision. I am currently Past-President of the Manitoba Water Polo Association and Board Secretary with the Manitoba Eco-Network.\r\n\r\nOver the past several years I have created a number of successful projects ranging from starting an ad-hoc aid organization following a deadly earthquake I survived, to the 25 litre Water Conservation Challenge, an annual event that has saved more than a million litres of water.  \r\n\r\n**Is there anything in particular you would like to change in our province? In your electoral division?**\r\n\r\nThere are a number of things I would like to seen changed, not so much in our province but in how our province is governed. I do not like to see the government absorbing Manitoba Hydro’s profits and calling it general revenue, this money should be reinvested in more renewable energy sources or offered in rebates to those you practice energy conservation. I think that more focus in our government departments must be placed on efficiency and preventative measures \r\n\r\n**What is one thing you stand for that is not a part of your political party's platform?**\r\n\r\nI feel very strongly that we need to relook at our drug laws in Manitoba and in Canada. It genuinely angers me to think that many of my friends are “criminals”  merely due to the recreational drug they choose. I know architects, lawyers, entrepreneurs, doctors, and politicians who enjoy using marijuana and while I do not condone its use, prohibitive drugs laws, especially in the case of marijuana, do much more harm than good. There is a good possibility that revisiting these laws on a provincial and federal level could help to save an enormous about of money while debilitating organized crime  \r\n\r\n**Do you have any other comments regarding your candidacy?**\r\n\r\nMy campaign has been run in an unconventional manner as I am an unconventional candidate. We are placing little effort into fundraising and instead focusing all of our effort on engaging the electorate through a variety of methods not used by other candidates such as online videos, twitter and facebook, bicycle convoys, public and school presentations and striving to spend at least one day canvassing with other candidates.  \r\n\r\n**What is your favourite location in the electoral division you are currently a candidate for?**\r\n\r\nI have a number of favorite spots in my electoral division. I enjoy trying some of the 150 kinds of beer I can get at Luxalune Gastropub, the Park Theatre is always a fun place to be, and Delicious restaurant on Pembina Highway has some of Winnipeg’s best vegetarian fare. But my favourite spots have to be along the riverfront on Churchill Drive and South Drive. At one spot in particular, halfway from the Riverview Health Centre to the Rowing Club is a secluded spot along the riverwalk where there is a large stone slab which has a lovely quote carved on it and a couple of seats to sit. It is only a few kilometres from downtown but it feels like the country, it is a pretty magical little spot.",

      "questionnaire": "**Why did you decide to run in the 2011 Manitoba election?**\r\n\r\nAs a long-time resident, I know the values and needs of the area.  I can bring better representation and advocacy on safety, housing, transit and the other issues affecting our neighbourhoods.  People are better served by an MLA who lives in the constituency and who will fight for our needs.\r\n\r\n**What experience will you bring to compliment your role as MLA?**\r\n\r\nI have experience in government, having worked for a federal cabinet minister before starting my career.   I have studied the language of law and understand our provincial legal system, including its strengths and failings.  As a citizen, I have been very active in the community.  For example, I co-founded the Winnipeg Rapid Transit Coalition which advocates for improvements to transit and building rapid transit. \r\n\r\n**Is there anything in particular you would like to change in our province? In your electoral division?**\r\n\r\nThere are many things that need change or improvement.  Our health care system needs to work better for patients.  We need to invest more in early childhood learning and screening of treatable conditions.  We are not yet properly dealing with the diabetes epidemic.  The waiting list for addiction treatment spots is far too long.  The list goes on and on.\r\n\r\nIn Fort Rouge, we need to undo some of the damage to community safety.  When the NDP took power 12 years ago, there was a community police station in the area.  That has been closed.  There was a regular foot patrol in Osborne Village.  That ended.  Community officers have been redeployed to other areas.  I will work to bring back regular foot patrols to the area, likely through an expansion of the provincially-funded police cadet program.\r\n\r\nThe rental situation has also been badly deteriorating.  The vacancy rate is at 0.7% and keeps dropping. Many rental buildings have been converted to condominiums, but new apartments aren't been built to replace them. Many people have had their rents go up by 10% or more per year. I will fight for renters. This includes pushing for more apartments to be built by the rapid transit stations being built. I will also fight for changes to the Residential Tenancies Act.\r\n \r\n**What is one thing you stand for that is not a part of your political party's platform?**\r\n\r\nThere are always local needs that are unique. As MLA, I will be working to fund and designate an off-leash dog park in the constituency.\r\n\r\n**Do you have any other comments regarding your candidacy?**\r\n\r\nAround the world, people have been fighting for the right to participate in democracy. The revolutions in north Africa and the Middle East show that people are fighting for what we often take for granted. We must embrace democracy.\r\n\r\nMany people are interested when I come to their door. They appreciate a candidate who takes the time to meet with them and listen to them. I am inspired when people here fully engage in democracy.\r\n\r\n**What is your favourite location in the electoral division you are currently a candidate for?**\r\n\r\nI live very close to some great restaurants. With my sweet tooth, I have a soft spot for Baked Expectations.",

      "questionnaire": "**Why did you decide to run in the 2011 Manitoba election?**\r\n\r\nI have spent the past 24 years as a City of Winnipeg Police Officer and have witnessed firsthand the challenges that both adults and children face each day. I feel that many Government programs are simply missing the mark when it comes to giving people the tools and support they need to improve their lives long term. I want to work in the Manitoba Legislature to not only assist the residents of St. James with their individual needs but to develop working solutions to large provincial issues like poverty, crime and education. I plan on being a politician who operates with 100% honesty at all times and with a focus on solving issues once and for all.\r\n\r\n**What experience will you bring to compliment your role as MLA?**\r\n\r\nI know that St. James is a great neighbourhood but I feel that the area and residents were really neglected by their last MLA. Through my work as a Police Officer and as a single dad, I know that life can be tough at some point for all of us. I want to make sure that people know they can turn to me as their MLA when they need help. I’m committed to being a fulltime MLA and I’m ready to work long hours to meet with constituents on their terms. I can also promise the residents of St. James that as their MLA, I will always remember that I’m working as public servant and that means doing more than cutting ribbons and smiling for photo opportunities.\r\n \r\n**Is there anything in particular you would like to change in our province? In your electoral division?**\r\n\r\nThe people I’m meeting in St. James are concerned about crime followed by health care and proper supports for seniors. I am also hearing from young parents that they are experiencing a shortage of affordable child care. I don't want parents of young children to have to worry about where they are going to find quality childcare for when they need it. In St. james I am also concerned about the quality of our roads. At a provincial level, I am committed to the prevention of Foetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD). I feel that FASD is one of the major issues that is impacting our ability to prevent and manage crime. I also believe that we have to concentrate on our education system as that is the key to solving so many of today's societal problems and establishing positive building blocks for the future.\r\n \r\n**What is one thing you stand for that is not a part of your political party's platform?**\r\n\r\nI believe our government must figure out how they can hold parents accountable for repeated anti-social behaviour by their children. There is no expectation placed on parents for how they parent their children and there is no accountability for parents on how their children behave in the community. This all starts at the Hospital when we first take our kids home with us. We need to inform the parent(s) about their social responsibility and accountability is in raising their child to adulthood and how their actions or non-action will play a role in the childs positive or negative development.\r\n \r\n**Do you have any other comments regarding your candidacy?**\r\n\r\nI'm very excited to be running for MLA of St. James. I've just about made it out to every home in the constituency and I can honestly say that St. James residents are some of the nicest people you will ever meet. I think whether I win or not I'll be able to look back and be glad I but my name forward as as candidate for such a great neighbourhood. I am also proud that we ran this campaign from a shoestring budget that focused on door knocking and didn't simply rely an expensive commercial campaign. I am disappointed that no other candidate in St James agreed to a debate. After contacting each of my opponents they both declined my suggestions that we should organize a debate. I believe that the residents of St James or any other electoral division should have that opportunity to see the candidates in action. Elections should be about background, ideas and passion and not just money to run a commercial campaign. \r\n \r\n**What is your favourite location in the electoral division you are currently a candidate for?**\r\n\r\nI really enjoy stopping in and grabbing an ice cream at Sargent Sundae then taking a stroll over the Assiniboine Park footbridge. I also like the Red Boot Drive-in next to my campaign office: great burgers!",

For example, we know that we have an aging population and we need to better plan for the future needs of baby boomers.  We also need to get a handle, once and for all, on the escalating crime rate in our province.  To do that we must focus on better educating our young people; ensuring they have access to a broad range of evening, weekend and summer activities; and we must work collaboratively with police and community members, to put a stop to increasing gang activity in our cities and communities.  We must ensure we implement measures to prevent crime, at the same time we need to ensure we deal promptly and effectively with convicted criminals and send a strong message that criminal activity will not be tolerated in Manitoba.  We must focus on better supporting families and strengthening communities.  In St. Norbert Constituency, we also have a very diverse population and must better understand the needs of a wide variety of ethnic communities, new immigrants, youth and seniors. \r\n \r\n**What is one thing you stand for that is not part of your political party’s platform?**\r\n\r\nI believe that the provincial government in Manitoba must work more closely and collaboratively with businesses and cities, towns and municipalities.  I personally would like to see a significant improvement to the amount of red tape that businesses must go through when dealing with government.  Also, I have long advocated for changing the legislation to allow farmer’s markets to be open more days during the week and to study the feasibility of making the St. Norbert Farmer’s Market a year-round facility.\r\n \r\n**Do you have any other comments regarding your candidacy?**\r\n\r\nI would just like to say that as a lifelong resident of this community and constituency, I have an excellent understanding of the area demographics and needs.  I also have a proven track record as both a City Councillor and MLA of getting things done in the community and of standing up for the residents of my community.\r\n \r\n**What is your favourite location in the electoral division you are currently a candidate for?**\r\n\r\nIn addition to my own backyard, my favourite location has to be any of the wonderful parks and walking trails throughout our community, including our own St. Norbert Art Centre located on the Trappistes Monastery site.",

      "questionnaire": "**Why did you decide to run in the 2011 Manitoba election?**\r\n\r\nI am proud to be running for the green party of Manitoba, which is not only a Manitoba movement, a Canadian movement,  but an International movement.\r\n\r\nI believe that current political activity in our community has become complacent and that our residents deserve better. Our community is in need of change. When you vote green you are sending a message to the other parties that the environment is important to you, worth saving, and that you want to capitalize on the opportunity to move toward an eco-economy that is sustainable and puts money in the pockets of the everyday regular Manitobans not in the pockets of multi-national companies. \r\n\r\n**What experience will you bring to compliment your role as MLA?**\r\n\r\n As a parent and former teacher, the education and wellbeing of our children is extremely important to me. If elected, one of my first tasks is getting green policy into the school system and green education into the classrooms province wide. As well, I am currently working on a zero waste - Green lunch program, a recycling program, and a composting program in schools in River East. If the 3 R's principles are preached but not practiced then they will not work, thus the school system and the curriculum need to work together. The only way to reduce the waste on our planet is to have the next generation on board and committed.\r\n\r\n**Is there anything in particular you would like to change in our province? In your electoral division?**\r\nI stand for a permanent dike, on Bonner Ave, which is a municipal issue but it fringes on provincial flooding management.  Bonner Ave between Rothesay and Henderson floods almost every spring due to high water levels of the Winnipeg Red River. Therefore, a temporary dike must be built year after year to protect the homes and street. The costs to build a dike, tear down, plus repair the damage caused by the massive construction equipment is in the hundreds of thousands if not the millions each time.  By not having to repair the street, curb, boulevard, driveways, and lawns each spring this will this save us tax payers.\r\n\r\nBy building an eco friendly permanent dike it will not only be an aesthetic improvement but McIvor park pedestrian and bike trails will flow continuously from one side of creek to the other side without Bonner Ave cutting through it.  This will help divert the traffic on Bonner to use the new Chief Peguis extension. It is still unknown if the new extension will live up to the promises conservatives made to the community and to not ghettoize the area around, as the Disreali bridge did to Elmwood and Point Douglas. \r\n\r\n**What is one thing you stand for that is not a part of your political party's platform?**\r\n\r\nImmediately, call centres working on behalf of political parties in this election should be disallowed access to, and the use of the voters list. There are no guarantees that the list is not being added to contact lists for other purposes. It should be either volunteers or paid party staff that uses the voters list.  This list is given out by elections Manitoba to the candidate and when Elections Manitoba hands over the list they should ask the candidate to sign that they will not give this list over to the private sector. I feel it Borderline fringes on privacy act in this country.  If not illegal, I believe it is morally and ethically irresponsible and the public should demand  Elections Manitoba to put a stop to this.\r\n\r\n**Do you have any other comments regarding your candidacy?**\r\n\r\nAn issue of great concern to me that no other candidate appears to be talking about is the dumping of raw sewage into the Red River by West St. Paul Elementary school. This is just 1 km beyond our River East constituency. Dumping raw sewage is a health hazard to this community; which if elected I would put a stop to it.  Schools should be the pillars of our community paving the way by example.  By tabling this project pushing it into the future, it not only cost the environment, but it's a greater cost to the tax payer. \r\n\r\n**What is your favourite location in the electoral division you are currently a candidate for?**\r\n\r\nComing from my experience as a small business owner I make a strong effort to support small local businesses in my community. It’s hard to pick a favourite but Mountain Bean Coffee is a chic coffee shop and great meeting ground for  interesting people in the neighbourhood. As well, I enjoy shopping at the Canadian Nutrition Centre health food store in McIvor Mall. The owner is very knowledgeable about the products, which are not only organic but healthy.  If I have to pick one location McIvor Park / Bunn’s Creek wins hands down for me. Green space is so valuable to our communities that is why the Green Party is so passionate about protecting it.\r\n\r\nThank you for reading my answers and getting to know a little more about your River East Green Party candidate Kelly Mitchell.  Take a stand, a green vote today is a strategic vote, a vote for a better tomorrow.",

I want to be a champion for positive social change in my community and my province.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n**What experience will you bring to compliment your role as MLA?**\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nI will bring my 21 years of experience as an advocate and counselor in the social services field, as well as my experience in policy development to the Manitoba Legislature. As an advocate for social justice issues, one of my goals has been the inclusion and full-citizenship of all Manitobans.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n**Is there anything in particular you would like to change in our province? In your electoral division?**\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nYes. Currently, there are four groups (the aboriginal community, the poor, university students, persons with disabilities) which have traditionally not participated in our political process. I would like to engage these groups to become more active participants in our society. I am a strong believer in empowering individuals and communities to participate in society as “responsible citizens” and not just as taxpayers.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n**What is one thing you stand for that is not part of your political party’s platform?**\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nProvincial accessibility legislation for persons with disabilities. I believe that accessibility is a right.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n**Do you have any other comments regarding your candidacy?**\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nMy commitment to you: 1) Reduce the tax burden on all Manitobans 2) Eliminate the “job-killing” payroll tax which weakens our economy 3) Make crime and neighbourhood safety a priority 4) Deal with some of the social and root causes of crime such as poverty, homelessness and gangs 5) Lower the high school drop-out rates and reduce classroom overcrowding 6) Support Manitoba’s green economy and environmentally friendly initiatives\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n**What is your favourite location in the electoral division you are currently a candidate for?**\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nI have a couple of favourites.

      "questionnaire": "**Why did you decide to run in the 2011 Manitoba election?**\r\n\r\nI am involved with a number of community organizations and felt the real need to be “an advocate for our community in government, rather than a advocate for government in our community” which has been the complaint I've heard most about the incumbent. I really don't like the generic programing that the NDP spit out and expect to work the same in every area. We need government programs to be flexible to meet various needs.\r\n\r\n**What experience will you bring to compliment your role as MLA?**\r\n\r\nI have B.A. & an M.A. in Economics so I understand theory, I own my own business in the area so I get the practical and I live in the area and sit on the boards of: West Broadway Biz, West Broadway Development Corporation, & Westminister United so I am a part of the community. I bring a range of experience and energy from the area to work on the real issues in the area.\r\n\r\n**Is there anything in particular you would like to change in our province? In your electoral division?**\r\n\r\nThere are a couple of provincial things\r\n\r\n* People should be able to live on their pay cheques, but the NDP just keep raising the minimum wage which only raises costs for everybody. The smarter solution is to raise the basic personal income tax exemption amount. The current exemption amount in Manitoba is $8,384, which is less than 60% of the $14,535 exemption amount in Saskatchewan. I think people want to keep more of their pay cheque. \r\n\r\n* I want to make sure tax dollars strengthen our community rather than increase red tape that hampers government transparency. The current spending by NDP is over $10-million a year on advertising. Liberals propose eliminating advertising for government services without competition and restricting it to essential information only.\r\nIn our community – which is made up of West Broadway, Armstrong Point, Assiniboine, the West End and Wolseley- in other words “the early suburbs”, there are a huge need to deal with the ageing infrastructure and the city can't fix it alone. We need to develop longer-term partnerships to deal with it rather than one-off projects that patch one spot at a time. \r\n\r\n**What is one thing you stand for that is not a part of your political party's platform?**\r\n\r\nWell I'm running because I feel the incumbent is more of a spokesman for his party than an advocate for the area so things that are area issues like supporting small business initiatives protecting the green canopy, riverbank stabilization, and housing initiatives that fit with the neighbourhood that has had “a lot of talk but only a little done” would a priority. I'd put the community first and the party second.\r\n\r\n**Do you have any other comments regarding your candidacy?**\r\n\r\nIt is important to me that people participate – “if I can't get your vote, at least I can get you to vote” is a bit of a motto for me. It bothers me when I hear somebody say “I never vote”, politics should be an opportunity for people to show that they care not a nuisance to be avoided.\r\n\r\n**What is your favourite location in the electoral division you are currently a candidate for?**\r\n\r\nI really like the river walk between Cornish and the Osborne Street bridge. It is a great place and I've taken some of my favourite pictures there.",

      "questionnaire": "**Why did you decide to run in the 2011 Manitoba election?**\r\n\r\nI have decided to run for office because I firmly believe that you and your children need an active voice to lead from a reference point of passion and responsibility. The type of change I seek should quickly effect education, healthy active living, social justice, and crime. I know the time is now. I feel that it is very necessary for young people to grab the torch that is being passed to us. It's up to us to take this responsibility seriously and, regardless of what we are passionate about (e.g., politics, business, community), we have begin to think of conventional and unconventional methods to encourage progress. My campaign slogan, N4N, reminds all of us that we must act NOW to change our communities and usher in that change with NEW ideas and energy.\r\n\r\n**What experience will you bring to compliment your role as MLA?**\r\n\r\nI have worked as a youth care worker for the past 5 years. In 2009, I founded a community organization called Community Vibes Incorporated. Through this group, I have been involved in planning forums related to crime and safety as well as engaging youth and young professionals in their communities. The Community Vibes Cook Out event in Central Park (June 2010 and 2011) has also been an important piece to bringing the community and business together while encouraging cultural understanding and civic pride.\r\n\r\n**Is there anything in particular you would like to change in our province? In your electoral division?**\r\n\r\nIn Manitoba and in Seine River, politics needs revitalization. Young people need to become more engaged and those from previous generations also need a voice and feel a sense of respect. I feel I am the best candidate to bring these together and transform the area and our province. Also, particularly in Seine River, access to affordable daycare needs to be addressed as well as the promotion of health and physical activity for young and old alike.\r\n\r\n**Do you have any other comments regarding your candidacy?**\r\n\r\nI urge all voters in Seine River to make an informed choice. Find out about me and my ideas at [www.now4new.ca](http://www.now4new.ca). I look forward to meeting you all.",

      "questionnaire": "**Why did you decide to run in the 2011 Manitoba election?**\r\n\r\nThree years ago, my daughter contacted Gary Doer, Theresa Oswald, Hugh McFayden and Jon Gerrard with a request for help. Jon Gerrard was the only politician who responded. Jon helped us navigate the health care system to have my daughter placed on the waiting list for a double hip transplant. Six months later, my daughter had both her hips replaced one week apart. It fundamentally changed her life. From this experience, I have learned that one person can make a significant difference in the lives of others. I am running to make a difference for the voters in Dawson Trail.\r\n \r\n**What experience will you bring to compliment your role as MLA?**\r\n\r\nIn my current position, I am a project manager and educator.  In my role as a project manager, I am used to working on timelines with tight budgets to meet specific objectives.  As a project manager, my most valuable assets are my team members.  I will use the same philosophy to build a cohesive team of voters from all parties that will serve as my mentors and advisors in Dawson Trail.  I know that I don’t have all the answers.  However, just like all the projects that I have worked on, I know that the people in my electoral division can be part of the solution.\r\n           \r\n**Is there anything in particular you would like to change in our province? In your electoral division?**\r\n\r\nI would like to have our province viewed as a sum of its parts.  We have urban, rural and northern areas with very different areas and concerns.  I would like to see a comprehensive Manitoba-centric strategy for leveraging the strengths of voters and their families.  It is time to develop a vision of our province in 10 years, 20 years and 30 years – 4 year increments isn’t working right now. \r\n \r\n**What is one thing you stand for that is not a part of your political party's platform?**\r\n\r\nTo a large degree, I agree with the overarching platform or I won’t be running as a candidate for the Liberal Party.  I am a proponent of lifespan learning programs.  I think that families and individuals should have access to an education strategy that encompasses early childhood through retirement.  For example:  We need to offer more online degree programs such as MBAs so that individuals in rural and northern areas are able to continue to their education without having to travel to centers such as Winnipeg and Brandon.\r\n\r\n**Do you have any other comments regarding your candidacy?** \r\n\r\nI would ask all voters to vote.  Whether you support a specific party or decline your ballot, vote. Your vote is your voice.  Be heard.\r\n\r\n**What is your favourite location in the electoral division you are currently a candidate for?**\r\n\r\nIt would be my home.",

      "questionnaire": "**Why did you decide to run in the 2011 Manitoba election?**\r\n\r\nThe Opportunity presented itself from the Progressive Conservative Party of Manitoba to run in the 2011 elections for the Flin Flon Riding. After careful consideration and reviewing the PC’s Principals and Policies and the encouragement from the People of Nisichawayasihk Cree Nation I decided I would run as I had an interest in local politics at early age as my Father has been in Council for 20 years and I have seen the hard work and sacrifices he has committed for the People of NCN and I feel that I can represent the communities within the Flin Flon Riding, and have a voice for them, so that they can be apart of the Government in Power.\r\n\r\n**What experience will you bring to compliment your role as MLA?**\r\n\r\nI obtained my Business Administration Diploma with a Major in Management and I am currently enrolled in Financial Management Accounting through distance education with the University of Manitoba. I am currently employed as the Contract & Financial Administrator for our Wuskwatim Implementation Office where I display strong work ethics, professionalism and accountability. I am also a Trustee for NCN Taskinigahp Trust and a Board of Director for NCN Parks & Recreation. I strongly believe that these work experiences that I am currently involved in as well as the education I am pursuing have given me experience to compliment me as a MLA.\r\n\r\n**Is there anything in particular you would like to change in our province? In your electoral division?**\r\n\r\nI have seen the neglect from the Provincial Government in Power with regards to Northern Issues in the Flin Flon Riding such as: Education, Health Care, Infrastructure, Child and Family Services, Housing, Roads, Crime, Poverty etc… Lac Brochet, Brochet and Tadoule Lake don’t even have Hydro Electric Power and they are only accessible by airway and winter road. It is time that these issues are looked at seriously as these communities are a part of our Great Province of Manitoba.\r\n\r\n**What is one thing you stand for that is not a part of your political party's platform?**\r\n\r\nI agree with the Principals and Policies of the Progressive Conservative Party, so I cannot think of anything I stand for that is not party of the PC Platform.\r\n\r\n**Do you have any other comments regarding your candidacy?**\r\n\r\nWith regards to my candidacy I would like to see the voter turn increase in the Flin Flon Riding as the last election saw a low voter turn out through out the whole riding. I especially want to see the Aboriginal Voter turn out to Increase significantly. I want them to get involved, to come out and vote and change the statistics.\r\n\r\n**What is your favourite location in the electoral division you are currently a candidate for?**\r\n\r\nNCN is my Favorite location in my electoral division as I grew up here; however the whole Flin Flon Riding is a wonderful place, with our Natural Resources and Beautiful Environment Surroundings.",

      "questionnaire": "**Why did you decide to run in the 2011 Manitoba election?**\r\n \r\nI am running in this campaign as I have been concerned about the direction of Steinbach and all our communities during these periods of high growth. I recently ran in the municipal campaign in Steinbach, concerned primarily about issues such as crime and addictions prevention in our city, as well as addressing the issues that have come with rapid growth. As a lifelong resident of Steinbach I want to see these periods of prosperity continue and make sure that we are being proactive in dealing with the issues facing us today and tomorrow. It is my belief that our riding has been neglected by our current government and I have a belief that we can do things better in our communities.\r\n\r\n \r\n**What experience will you bring to compliment your role as MLA?**\r\n\r\nMy recent experience as a candidate for Steinbach City Council gave me an opportunity to listen to the residents of Steinbach and hear many of the concerns addressing all of us. It also allowed me to meet and communicate with members of our current city council so I understand the issues affecting not only our local citizens but also at the municipal government level. I am a relatively new face to the political scene in the area but this also allows me to distance myself from some old trends that have not worked and to hopefully bring some new ideas to the table.\r\n\r\n \r\n**Is there anything in particular you would like to change in our province? In your electoral division?**\r\n\r\nI am tired of the polarized politics that have always left parts of our province in the dark and out of the provincial government’s eye. North versus south, urban versus rural, these trends have gotten Manitoba nowhere over the last two decades and the last two governments. If we work together as a province we can stop the interprovincial migration losses and work together to once again put Manitoba forward as a prosperous “have” province. \r\n\r\nLocally I still find the issues of crime and addictions prevention to be very important. This was a much talked about issue in the 2010 municipal campaign and I would love to make sure that the front line services in Steinbach have the appropriate resources they need to combat this. The communities in the riding are all growing rapidly however and there are many issues to address. It is important that we elect a government that is prepared to no longer ignore our communities and brings a solid platform to address the issues of high growth.\r\n\r\n \r\n**What is one thing you stand for that is not a part of your political party's platform?**\r\n\r\nI find that some of the environmental laws in our province are quite appalling. One issue I would like to address is whether or not we should continue to allow logging and mining in our provincial parks. It is my belief that provincial parks should be set aside to preserve these areas for future generations and for recreation. Instead, I believe that logging and mining should be set aside for provincial forests which are intended for these uses.\r\n\r\n \r\n**Do you have any other comments regarding your candidacy?**\r\n\r\nI am so happy to be a young candidate in a rapidly growing area. My goal here is to not only represent the historical issues and people in our riding but also bring some new ideas and represent the changing face of our riding as well. Together we can make our communities and safer and more prosperous place to live for all.\r\n\r\n \r\n**What is your favourite location in the electoral division you are currently a candidate for?**\r\n\r\nWhile I do have many favourite locations I would have to say that I love riding my road bicycle. As such I have a route that takes me from Steinbach, up the 52 highway and then loops through Kleefeld and back down Ridge Road to Steinbach. This covers the whole of my riding and I enjoy the relaxing and wonderful view of the entire area as I travel these roads.",

      "questionnaire": "**Why did you decide to run in the 2011 Manitoba election?**\r\n\r\nThis is my third approach to the legislature. I got involved early with the Conservatives and was the candidate in Radisson until Stuart Murray fired Steven Fletcher via email so I approached the Liberals and ran in 2004 & 2007 in Radisson.\r\n\r\nI have successfully ran in two civic elections and one provincial election without spending a tax payer penny. I want to win a sizable area without money to show how ludicrous the whole system is and to have no hidden agendas or owe any favors.  I want to show tomorrows youth that they do not need money to run for office and restore faith in the political world. \r\n\r\n**What experience will you bring to compliment your role as MLA?**\r\n\r\nI have been a contract salesman for over twenty years. I have sold to and have worked with original equipment manufacturer to suppliers to process to farmers to office workers and have an excellent skill of listening for the language of needs. I am very passionate in getting the very best value for all for the best market price in the best time so this would compliment my roll as MLA and would give great value and benefits to all the voters.\r\n\r\n**Is there anything in particular you would like to change in our province? In your electoral division?**\r\n\r\nYes, I would like to remove the payroll tax and reduce the provincial sales tax to six and split it with the business owner and move the minimum wage to twelve dollars to kick start the economy. If you drive safely for the year the provincial government should pay for your license as this would save millions in property damage ...we should address the over bloated WRHA and open up the kitchens in all the hospitals.\r\n\r\nThe electoral area should stay the same.\r\n\r\n**What is one thing you stand for that is not a part of your political party's platform?**\r\n\r\nThe first nation demographic shift is being totally ignored here in Manitoba. I met a chief from Northern Saskatchewan in Saskatoon and I asked him what and how can we help. He told me that every time they would approach Ottawa or Regina they would get out there cheque book... this is how we deal with the shift...we need to approach them and work towards a better future for all Manitoba people including first nations. Work and establish strategies for a better relationship and future and understand there language of needs. \r\n\r\n**Do you have any other comments regarding your candidacy?**\r\n\r\nI am running in a Conservative stronghold and want to offer the voters a alternative to the current boring, self-centered and egotistical Conservatives. I offer a clean slate with no relationships and no hidden agenda’s and without electing me the voters of Arthur Virden have already saved over twenty thousand dollars for implementing my zero penny campaign. I am ambitious and committed to listening to all the language of needs and will be ready for what the oil industry and first nations dicate.  \r\n\r\n**What is your favourite location in the electoral division you are currently a candidate for?**\r\n\r\nThis is by far the most difficult question. The entire electoral division is amazing in size and beauty. The place that I remember with the sun going down just south of Pipestone on highway 83...",

      "questionnaire": "**Why did you decide to run in the 2011 Manitoba election?**\r\n\r\nI first became active with the Manitoba Liberal Party in the summer of 2010, after winning a scholarship from them upon my graduation from Shoal Lake School. Over the course of the ensuing year, I remained active with the party. Upon being contacted for the purpose of running in mid-August, I realized that the opportunity to run for public office is one that few people have the chance to experience in their lifetime. Running in an election is a wonderful experience to interact with one's electoral division, and really learn about the people that live there.\r\n\r\n**What experience will you bring to complement your role as MLA?**\r\n\r\nI grew up entirely in rural Manitoba, on my parents' farm outside of Shoal Lake. I still enjoy a strong family connection with the people of my home division. As well, through studying and living in Winnipeg, I have developed an understanding of the challenges and issues facing urban life in Manitoba as well. Legislation in Manitoba needs to take into account both sides of this important coin, and I believe that the dual lives I have lived will allow me to see both perspectives on divisive issues. As well, my family connections in the area allow me to constantly stay up to date on the issues facing the rural residents of the province.\r\n\r\n**Is there anything in particular that you want to change about our province? In your electoral division?**\r\n\r\nI think that Manitoba deserves more respect on the national scale than it currently gets. Out diversified economic approach has created a strong economy that can not only survive times of trouble, it can thrive in them. I think that other provinces need to look at our model and see the long-term success that we have created, instead of the short-term gains that seem so desirable. Manitoba is poised to become a \"have\" province, one of the strongest in the new Canada, and it is time for the rest of the country to realize it and give us the proper respect.\r\n\r\n**What is one thing you stand for that is not a part of your political party's platform?**\r\n\r\nI think that the moratorium on school closures in Manitoba is a policy that requires definite re-evaluation. The problem is complex, and a \"one case fits all\" approach is not going to act in anybody's best interest. When a school is being considered for closure, we must insure that the arguments of all interested parties are heard, and that the need for efficiency in administration and funding is balanced against our duty to provide the highest-quality and most convenient education to the children of this province. In this way, I would take a long, hard, look at the moratorium policy before making a decision to preserve such an ideal.\r\n\r\n**Do you have any other comments regarding your candidacy?**\r\n\r\nThough myself and my campaign team are running this particular campaign as a low-key affair, we are optimistic about our chances in this election. This may be my first time running in the political arena, but we believe that I can offer a fresh perspective and energy that has been lacking in the provincial political sphere here for rather a long time. We urge all of the voters in this election to take the time to examine the issues as they stand, and determine their opinion of them. Then, vote for the candidate that best represents what you want from the provincial government. \r\n\r\n**What is your favourite location in the electoral division that you are currently a candidate for?**\r\n\r\nMy favourite place will always be at home on the family farm, with the rest of my family. Even on a cold winter's morning, when the barn needs to be shovelled out, or a hot summer afternoon when a bin needs to be shovelled out, I would not rather be anywhere else.\r\n",

      "questionnaire": "**Why did you decide to run in the 2011 Manitoba election?**\r\n \r\nI’ve been so frustrated with past governments’ neglect of important community issues that I decided to run in 2007 and 2011.  \r\n\r\nUnfortunately, I am only able to campaign part-time. My campaign is fuelled entirely by my desire to make positive changes in Manitoba, and I do what I can outside of my regular work hours.  \r\n \r\n**What experience will you bring to compliment your role as MLA?**\r\n\r\nIn my spare time, I am a musician, writer and videographer. My role - in every aspect of my life - is to inspire. We haven’t seen any spark of inspiration in Canadian politics for a very long time, and it is just what’s needed to bring everyone together and bring positive change in Manitoba.  \r\n\r\nThe current government has become satisfied with the status quo and fails to provide a vision where Manitobans can become the very best. \r\n\r\n**Is there anything in particular you would like to change in our province? In your electoral division?**\r\n\r\nIn my electoral division, my focus is on the need of financial and social supports for our communities to thrive. A few examples are providing access to quality health care for those who can no longer commute to cities, ensuring our elderly have proper supports to stay in the communities they helped build, as well as providing new industry so new families can choose to plant roots in rural areas.  \r\n\r\nIn regards to my vision for Manitoba, I see our province running solely on renewable energy sources, other than hydro-electricity. Through investments in research and development, over time we can transition our communities and cities to using geo-thermal, solar and wind power, then - keeping Manitoba Hydro public – sell our hydro-electricity to neighbouring provinces and states. \r\n \r\n**What is one thing you stand for that is not a part of your political party's platform?**\r\n\r\nI agree with the Liberal Party’s platform, which is why I chose to run as a Liberal candidate. The Manitoba Liberal focus is on research, prevention and innovation; particularly in growing a sustainable economy, ensuring everyone has access quality health care, and providing all Manitobans with the best education at every level.\r\n\r\n**Do you have any other comments regarding your candidacy?**\r\n\r\nEvery candidate wants to improve the quality of life for every Manitoban; we just have different ideas of what needs to be done to get there. My ideas are new and refreshing, especially to those who’ve been consistently disappointed in the lack of results from past governments. Voters are just as eager as I am to see actual improvements, and the Liberal platform provides achievable solutions.  \r\n\r\nMy strong family roots in the Morris riding and my innovative vision for the future of our rural communities are just a few reasons to vote for me.  \r\nShould you vote for me, you would be choosing a young, passionate and fierce MLA. An adequate amount of time and an idealistic desire with unwavering drive are necessary characteristics for your representative to possess in order to build long-term sustainable improvements in our communities. \r\n \r\n**What is your favourite location in the electoral division you are currently a candidate for?**\r\n\r\nWhen I try to choose, I am touched by so many wonderful memories. My friends and family live in most of these communities, and each town is meaningful to me.",

      "questionnaire": "**Why did you decide to run in the 2011 Manitoba election?**\r\n\r\nI have been long frustrated by the failure of both the current and     previous provincial governments to deal effectively with the real issues of Winnipeg’s inner city. I believe it is time that inner city residents had a voice in the legislature that puts their issues first, that speaks for them and their concerns, and not the party that controls their vote. I am pledged to be that kind of voice in the legislature, as I have done my whole life.\r\n\r\n   I am also of the firm belief that we all face a growing environmental   crisis that none of the major parties are effectively dealing with. I have decided to run for the Green Party as the party most dedicated and best equipped to solving that crisis. If we fail to do so, for ourselves and future generations, then solutions to any other problems become meaningless. I also believe that the environment and the fight for social and economic fairness and justice for all are directly linked.\r\n\r\n**What experience will you bring to compliment your role as MLA?**\r\n\r\nFor the past 12 years, I have worked as an anti– poverty advocate for the Manitoba Low Income Intermediary Project, helping thousands of low income individuals and families resolve problems with various government and private agencies and find needed resources in the community.\r\n\r\nI am also employed  part time  by Winnipeg Harvest, working on  advocacy, research, and public education issues.\r\n\r\nI have served for several years on the Board of Directors of the Social Planning Council of Winnipeg, as a tenants representative on the Residential Tenancies Appeal Commission and on an advisory committee to the Minister on the Residential Tenancies Act. I am an active participant in the Make Poverty History Manitoba coalition, Winnipeg Poverty Advocacy Network, and numerous other organizations.\r\n\r\nI have worked in construction, in factories, and as a Workplace Safety and Health Inspector for the Province of Manitoba, and managed a bookstore.  I have been a union activist with the Canadian Autoworkers Union and the Manitoba Government Employees Union, repeatedly elected as shop steward and to local and regional leadership positions. Wherever I have worked, I have always been an activist for social justice.\r\n\r\n**Is there anything in particular you would like to change in our province? In your electoral division?**\r\n\r\n* Massive public investment to build affordable, quality housing for all.\r\n\r\n* A provincial food security initiative  to ensure the nutrition needs of all our citizens are met while ensuring the economic security of the family farmer. \r\n\r\n* Effective crime reduction through prevention, including expansion of community sports, recreational, and educational programs and supports for our youth, to keep  them off the  streets and out of gangs. \r\n\r\n* Better and lower cost health care through prevention, including nutritional supports, expanded public health education and community programs, and community fitness  centres.\r\n\r\n* Making Manitoba a true leader in solving our environmental crisis, through massive investment in public transit to reduce carbon emissions and dependency on fossil  fuels, elimination of practices and economic policies that result in the poisoning  of our air and water supplies, massive investment using Manitoba  Hydro profits to make all our homes and workplaces energy efficient instead of building new, environmentally damaging  mega-dams, and research and development of alternative low  impact energy production.\r\n\r\n* Meaningful, long term job creation through training and  employment placement of  local citizens to meet the demands of our programs listed above.\r\n\r\n\r\n**What is one thing you stand for that is not a part of your political party's platform?**\r\n\r\nOne of the overriding issues in Minto and throughout our inner city is poverty. It is one of the biggest factors driving up health care costs, while at the same time the level of front line preventative care and treatment is declining. This is aggravated by the establishment of numerous high volume, excessively profitable private walk in clinics that provide poor levels of service. I would advocate for the establishment of a number of inner city poverty health centres similar to Mount Carmel Clinic to more adequately service the health needs of our population.\r\n \r\n**Do you have any other comments regarding your candidacy?**\r\n\r\nWe are a new, young, and growing political force in Manitoba. I am proud to be affiliated with a movement that is taking the lead in this election in placing the environment and social and economic justice, based on a sound economic program, at the forefront in this election. Green voices in our legislature will change the political face of Manitoba for the better. I invite all voters to learn more about us at my website at [www.harolddyck.com](http://www.harolddyck.com), ot the Green Party site at [www.greenparty.mb.ca](http://www.greenparty.mb.ca). \r\n\r\n**What is your favourite location in the electoral division you are currently a candidate for?**\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to focus on one thing because there are so many great features in Minto, but I do particularly like the expansion of the University of Winnipeg, at the very edge of the riding, as an institution servicing many of the needs of Winnipeg's west end and downtown.\r\n\r\n",

      "questionnaire": "**Why did you decide to run in the 2011 Manitoba election?**\r\n\r\nFort Rouge needs a Green voice in the Manitoba Legislature. I am proud\r\nto be a Fort Rouge resident. For too long, the PC and NDP parties'\r\ngovernance has directly led to increased environmental degradation,\r\nhigher levels of crime, and a plethora of problems related to short\r\nterm minded decision making. Manitobans need new parties in the\r\nLegislature to keep the PC and NDP in line to ensure that future\r\ngenerations also have a high quality of life. We are not a two party\r\nprovince. Vote Green on October 4th for the sake of long term forward\r\nthinking, democracy, quality of life, and environmental\r\nsustainability.\r\n\r\n**What experience will you bring to compliment your role as MLA?**\r\n\r\nWorking with the public in the private and NGO sectors.  Traveling and\r\nliving abroad in 22 countries forced me to compare regional policies\r\nwhich has given me a keen sense of where the Manitoba government has\r\nprevailed and failed.\r\n\r\n**Is there anything in particular you would like to change in our province? In your electoral division?**\r\n\r\n* Increase funding to education facilities particularly post secondary to expand capacity to train more health and trades workers\r\n* Shift from current health model to a preventative approach\r\n* Shift to Universal Basic Income to reduce current bureaucracy in the fight against poverty\r\n* Make public transit free\r\n* Increase bike lanes\r\n* End current plans to build Bipole III\r\n* Shift freight to the rail system rather than wear out our roads, streets and highways\r\n* Shift from the current policing model to a community police model\r\n* Clean Lake Winnipeg and restore Manitoba's wetlands\r\n* Shift from retributive justice to restorative justice\r\n* Increase crime prevention by increasing youth opportunities and utilizing retributive justice\r\n* End any plans to have nuclear waste to be transported through Manitoba\r\n\r\n**What is one thing you stand for that is not a part of your political party's platform?**\r\n\r\nI would like to see a more competitive daycare market and one way to\r\nachieve this is to remove red tape to start a daycare business\r\nparticularly a small one that can be run by one person (ie: a single\r\nparent).\r\n\r\n**Do you have any other comments regarding your candidacy?**\r\n\r\nIf elected, I will be a strong representative for Fort Rouge. I\r\npromise to be accountable and transparent and open to constructive\r\ndialogue with my constituents.  The first thing I will do is hold a\r\nfirst of many public forums so Fort Rouge residents can personally\r\nvoice their concerns and issues to me.\r\n\r\n**What is your favourite location in the electoral division you are currently a candidate for?**\r\n\r\nOsborne Village!",

I will do that. I’m a believer that the best way to understand the local issues is to start talking to the people that live there. I’ve learned a lot from many of the other NDP MLA’s and sometimes it’s just the simple conversations at the doorstep that lead to the most effective solutions. I’ve been doing a lot of that – and have met many wonderful people on the doorstep and on the streets in Fort Whyte. It’s a dynamic\r\ncommunity that’s growing.\r\n\r\n**What experience will you bring to compliment your role as MLA?**\r\n\r\nI’m a proud Winnipegger and Manitoban. I’m interested in helping communities reach their potential and helping youth stay active. I’ve worked with the West Broadway Youth Outreach and Local Investment Toward Employment (LITE). I have spent the past three years working as the Community Engagement Manager for The Multiple Sclerosis Society of Canada in Manitoba, and this has enabled me to work hands-on with community members.\r\n\r\n**Is there anything in particular you would like to change in our province? In your electoral division?**\r\n\r\nLike I said, Fort Whyte is on the right path, growing and thriving. We need to champion that, and keep continuing this. But to keep things on the right path, and keep this a neighborhood that’s safe and fun for our children and diverse for entrepreneurs, we need to make sure we have representation in government that will be looking out for the best interests of the families.\r\n\r\n**What values or ideals will you adhere to if elected?**\r\n\r\nI think the biggest values anyone elected to office can bring to the job is honesty and commitment. You have to keep an open dialogue with constituents and be committed to helping them address their concerns. That’s why my first move would be to open a constituency office so people have a welcoming environment to raise their issues. And, you have to be honest. I’m genuine when I say I care about the community and the priorities for families and the vision they have for the neighborhood. It’s something we all share.\r\n\r\n**What do you enjoy most about the Fort Whyte electoral division?**\r\n\r\nIt has to be the diversity. There are so many wonderful people that live in this community.\r\n\r\n**Do you have any other comments regarding your candidacy?**\r\n\r\nGrowing up in Winnipeg's West End neighbourhood, studying International Development, and spending time living overseas is what initially spurred my interest in working at a community level. I've spent the last three years at the MS Society of Canada managing volunteers, working in communications and as a fundraiser with a focus in community engagement and I'm prepared to be a strong voice for the people of Fort Whyte.

      "questionnaire": "**Why did you decide to run in the 2012 Manitoba by-election?**\r\n\r\nI want to be the voice for the people of Fort Whyte. I will provide the real opposition voice that this province needs. The Green Party and I are ready to bring Manitoba into the 21st century.\r\n\r\n**What experience will you bring to compliment your role as MLA?**\r\n\r\nI've spent the majority of my career ensuring the safety of persons and property. I understand the basic desire for protection, and I now feel I need to carry that beyond home and work. I will start by protecting our resources and our environment. I think the NDP has been lax in its efforts to protect that which is most precious to us, our backyards, our pocketbooks. They are happy to throw our money at their problems, but continue to deliver little in the way of real social progress. We are ready to change things.\r\n\r\n**Is there anything in particular you would like to change in our province? In your electoral division?**\r\n\r\nThere are a multitude of changes the Green Party would like to make to this province, which can be viewed at [greenparty.mb.ca](http://greenparty.mb.ca). The first thing I would start with is my Honesty in Politics act. The pledge I made to the voters, and which was refused by Mr. Pallister, was to promise to serve my full term, in order to avoid another costly, unnecessary by-election. If I resigned before my term, as Mr. McFadyen and Mr. Pallister and another 10 MLAs have done in the last 15 years, I would agree to give back the government contributions to my pension. I would hope that this would inspire a spirit of loyalty to the voters, and ensure that civic duties aren't taken so lightly.\r\n\r\n**What values or ideals will you adhere to if elected?**\r\n\r\nThe Greens are ready to provide the real alternative for Manitobans. We want our government to be addressing the real concerns of our people. Instead of making token progress, like extending Sunday hours, the Greens would be passing legislation that protected our forests, our rivers and lakes, our invaluable assets which we hold dear. We would be making investments in society with programs like guaranteed annual income and addressing the root causes of homelessness and poverty. We want to make our tax dollars go farther and keep Manitoba moneyin Manitoba. We would start by ensuring a \"made in Manitoba\" buying policy for the government and ask our businesses to do the same.\r\n\r\n**What do you enjoy most about the Fort Whyte electoral division?**\r\n\r\nWhat makes the Fort Whyte area great is the residents' connection to Nature. They have a pristine wilderness environment right in their own backyards. In Fort Whyte Alive our populace can learn about and interact with Nature in meaningful ways. This is something I wish to provide all Manitobans, a rich and beautiful province with a thriving ecology and non-exploitive resource handling.\r\n\r\n**Do you have any other comments regarding your candidacy?**\r\n\r\nI want everyone to get out the vote. If you're someone who takes politics seriously you have to know it isn't enough just to go vote on your own anymore. In a time when voter turnout is at its lowest, we all have to try a little harder in order to make democracy work and get everyone involved. This September 4th, and in any election hereafter, don't just go vote by yourself. Take a friend, take a few, make it a group thing, convince them they should execute their rights. Do whatever it takes to get more voices heard. ",

This provides a unique outlook on the past and perspective for the future.\r\n\r\n**Is there anything in particular you would like to change in our province?

We need to plan for the long-term.  The biggest change needed for my electoral division will have to involve everyone, including outside of Manitoba.  We all need to stop polluting Lake Winnipeg.

I don’t see much of a difference between the other party platforms, whereas the Greens have put forth innovative solutions.  Judicious management of our finite resources seems like a no-brainer to me, yet no one else is coming from that standpoint.  Also admire the fact that the Greens will implement a good idea regardless of it source whereas others seem so entrenched in their party lines that progress is stifled. Manitobans are sick of parliamentary bickering. The greens in Europe came up with the slogan:  neither Right, nor Left – but Forward.  Love it.\r\n\r\n**Is there anything in particular you would like to change in our province?

I decided to be a candidate in the 2011 Manitoba election because I believe and support the party platform and my lifestyle is consistent in being environmentally conscientious and care for Mother Earth.  Essentially, not only do I see virtual non-existent or at best ineffective or meaningless representation in the riding I’m a candidate for, but I see non-visionary and exclusive representation in the province. Ultimately, I am concerned about all issues regarding government leadership in the province of Manitoba.\r\n\r\n**What experience will you bring to compliment your role as MLA?**\r\n\r\nThe experience I bring to the table is based on 30 plus years which includes entrepreneur, advocacy, counsellor, teacher/facilitator, school administrator, education management, policy developer, school program evaluator, consultant and advisor to educational institutions as well as chiefs and councils, etc. My viewpoints are inclusive in not only realizing there are problems in the communities and society, but what the problem solution processes are: as stated in my election pamphlet, I am aware of the ongoing concerns and issues.\r\n\r\n**Is there anything in particular you would like to change in our province? In your electoral division?**\r\n\r\nAs stated, I am concerned about effective representation and leadership in the province.  The Keewatinook Riding is the largest or most spread out in the province, I would address said electoral boundary.\r\n\r\n**What is one thing you stand for that is not a part of your political party's platform?**\r\n\r\nI stand for fairness and equitability for all concerned.  The outstanding Treaty Land Entitlement (T.L.E.) process has been too slow and deliberate.  There is no formal GREEN PARTY policy on the subject at this time, but as per experience I will contribute to the development of said policies.\r\n\r\n**Do you have any other comments regarding your candidacy?**\r\n\r\nI am a candidate for the GREEN PARTY and will uphold party policy, but most importantly I will be an MLA that represents all constituents, no matter which part of the riding they live.\r\n\r\n**What is your favourite location in the electoral division you are currently a candidate for?**\r\n\r\nI will effectively represent the total riding.",

      "questionnaire": "Aussi: <a href=\"#francais\">Les Réponses en Français</a>.\r\n\r\n**Why did you decide to run in the 2011 Manitoba election?**\r\n\r\nIt is by teaching geography and social studies to the youth in our community that I have become aware of the environmental problems that our species presently face, in retrospect, the problems that we have created.  It is from research and learning that I was influenced to run as a candidate for Saint-Boniface riding because I feel the need for a change in direction regarding environmental policies are necessary to improve quality of life.   \r\n \r\n**What experience will you bring to compliment your role as MLA?**\r\n\r\nHaving graduated from le Collège secondaire de Saint-Boniface in 1980, I then completed a post-secondary education degree at the Université de Saint-Boniface with a major in history.  Having been employed in the education field since 1992, I’ve gathered experience in the French immersion courses of Geography, Law and Social Studies at Charleswood School and Collège Béliveau.   \r\n \r\n**Is there anything in particular you would like to change in our province? In your electoral division?**\r\n\r\nBeing fluent in speaking the French language comes first.  Manitoba needs more francophone voices in the legislative assembly.  Secondly, 1 out of 3 children living in poverty is not acceptable.  I would propose the Green Party of Manitoba's policy of basic income for all, without conditions. \r\n\r\nSaint-Boniface housing has become run-down and it would be in the interest of the constituents to have it become the dignified community it once was to 15 or 20 years ago.  It is not apparent to me that building condominiums is a way of restoring character.  All this creates is breeding grounds for bed bugs and endless repair headaches for the tenants.  I would propose “laneway housing” in order to incorporate clean and affordable housing.\r\n\r\n \r\n**What is one thing you stand for that is not a part of your political party's platform?**\r\n\r\nThis question is irrelevant.  I stand for everything that is part of the Green Party of Manitoba’s platform, and that is unequivocal.\r\n\r\n**Do you have any other comments regarding your candidacy?**\r\n\r\nI have an immense mountain to climb, but win or lose, I stand for what I believe in, and that is part of the Green Party platform: equal opportunity for all Manitobans and all my constituents, the best quality of life by promoting healthy food and clean air, a true sense of community, a safe community, equal rights for all and an end to poverty; this is true democracy.\r\n\r\n**What is your favorite location in the electoral division you are currently a candidate for?**\r\n\r\nMy favorite location in the electoral division is in my home with my wife Susan and my two children Rachelle and Nicole, and THAT is unequivocal. \r\n\r\n\r\n<a name=\"francais\"></a>\r\n##Les Réponses en Français\r\n\r\n**Pourquoi  as-tu décidé  de te présenter comme candidat dans la présente élection?**\r\n\r\nL’enseignement des sujets de géographie et des sciences humaines, tout en tenant les jeunes au courant des évènements environnementaux qui leurs entours, exige de la préparation et de la recherche afin d’atteindre les objectifs du programme. C’est à cette épreuve que je me suis éveillé  aux problèmes environnementaux que nous envisageons, et en même temps, les problèmes que nous avons créés.  Je trouve que nous devons réévaluer les projets de lois afin de redéfinir le développement durable et d’améliorer la qualité  de la vie à tous les niveaux. \r\n\r\n**Quelle formation amèneras-tu dans ton rôle comme membre élu de l’assemblée?**\r\n\r\nJe possède un baccalauréat en éducation de l’Université  de Saint-Boniface,  les cours d’histoires étant mes cours majeurs.  Étant donné  que je travail dans le domaine de l’éducation depuis 1992, mes plus grandes expertises sont centrées vers les sujets de sciences humaines, du droit et de la géographie.  L’enseignement de ces cours a eu lieu aux niveaux secondaires aux écoles d’immersion française de Charleswood School et du Collège Béliveau.\r\n\r\n**Est-ce qu’il y a des éléments dans la province et dans ta circonscription que tu trouves pourrais subir des changements?**\r\n\r\nD’abord, étant donné que je suis français de souche et que le français soit ma langue de communication, je trouve que les francophones du Manitoba devraient être mieux représentés dans l’assemblée.  Deuxièmement, je trouve que les domiciles à Saint-Boniface sont dans un état pitoyable.  Nous avons besoin de revitaliser Saint-Boniface pour qu’elle retrouve sa splendeur elle avait il y a une quinzaine d’année.  Je ne suis pas d’accord que les copropriétés soient une façon de reprendre cette  splendeur.  Tout ce que nous sommes en train de produire sont des niches de punaises et des réparations à long terme.\r\n\r\n**Quelle est un élément que tu supportes qui ne fait pas partie de la plateforme électorale de ton parti?**\r\n\r\nCette question n’a aucune pertinence.  Ma vision est basée sur la politique des Verts du Manitoba, tel le principe de précaution et l’environnement, et ceci est sans équivoque.\r\n\r\n**Pourrais-tu faire d’autres commentaires concernant ta candidature comme membre élu?**\r\n\r\nC’est tout un sommet que je dois franchir, mais selon le résultat, je me dévoue à la cause du Parti Vert du Manitoba; la justice sociale, la meilleure qualité de vie possible, vivre en harmonie dans la communauté, la primauté du droit et mettre fin à la pauvreté et tous ceci définie la démocratie. \r\n \r\n**Quel est l’endroit préféré  que tu fréquentes dans ta circonscription électorale?**\r\n\r\nMon endroit préféré est près de ma femme Susan et avec mes enfants Rachelle et Nicole, et CECI EST sans équivoque.",

      "questionnaire": "**Why did you decide to run in the 2011 Manitoba election?**\r\n\r\nWhile I have a great life, I know that some of my neighbours are struggling, such as my low-income, Anishinabe neighbours. Now that I know what some of my neighbours are up against, and their challenges are largely caused by policy, I have to act to remove any and all policy barriers. Some policies benefit me at the expense of my neighbour, i.e., I pay low taxes but apparently too low, because our government does not have enough money to ensure affordable housing for all. It is not good enough that most of us in our country have it pretty good while some of us struggle. There is enough for everyone and I want to work for equal access to economy, culture, and political power for every person.\r\n\r\n**What experience will you bring to compliment your role as MLA?**\r\n\r\nI am a small \"p\" philosopher, small \"t\" theologian, and keenly interested in our community story. In short, my analytical brain can bring a new way of thinking and problem-solving to the table. This is my approach to community-building through politics:\r\n\r\n1. Understand that we, people in the community, know our strengths and our challenges best and that we have the wisdom, resources, people, and co-operation to meet any challenges.\r\n2. Understand that, given the chance, neighbours have good intentions toward one another, believe the best about one another, and like to see the best for one another.\r\n3. Understand that the current way we do democracy no longer adequately reflects the complexity and diversity of our community and that we need to change this immediately—then we can access our ALL community strengths to meet all our community challenges.\r\n4. Understand that the solutions to our challenges must inherently attend to the needs of our current community as well as future generations and; therefore, must be fiscally and environmentally responsible.\r\n5. Understand that when you fight poverty, you fight illness, fight mental illness, fight domestic abuse, fight demoralized workforce syndrome, fight crime, fight hunger, fight elevated high-school drop-out rates, fight an inadequate tax base, fight gang participation\r\n\r\n**Is there anything in particular you would like to change in our province? In your electoral division?**\r\n\r\nIt is absolutely imperative that we re-engage our neighbours in politics. The voter turn out is unacceptably low and it is actually a crisis of democracy. A disengaged population is one easily abused and misrepresented by government. A disengaged population makes it easy for governments to simply pander to corporate interests, to equate “economy” with “what’s good for people”, to ignore our more vulnerable neighbours. A disengaged population will get exactly what they expect from government, and worse. We need to muster the political will to modernize our democracy to reflect the complexity of our times, i.e., introduce proportional representation, for one.\r\n\r\n**What is one thing you stand for that is not a part of your political party's platform?**\r\n\r\nThe nice thing about the Green Party is that it is still by the people for the people, it hasn't turned into a machine in a rut that shuts down new and independent thinking. Greens are welcome to bring any idea to the table, it's more about a general approach to community building and as such, it's very easy for voters to fit in. We've policies that attract traditionally conservative, liberal, and ndp voters and those who do not usually vote.\r\n\r\n**Do you have any other comments regarding your candidacy?**\r\n\r\nI enjoy meeting my neighbours and hearing about what matters to them. I learn something new in each conversation and deepen my appreciation for our diversity and beauty.\r\n\r\n**What is your favourite location in the electoral division you are currently a candidate for?**\r\n\r\nActually, the Dauphin Constituency is one of the most beautiful places I know. It's the reason we moved to the area five years ago ... it's an outdoor wonderland without the droves of people. My favorite highway bicycle ride is number five between Roblin and Grandview. For off-road riding, any of the back roads will do!",

I love my home and feel a responsibility to do the best I can to ensure our grandchildren have access to the same or better managed resources that we do in 2011.\r\n\r\n**What experience will you bring to compliment your role as MLA?**\r\n\r\nI have served as the national president of Canadian Organic Growers and remain the chairperson of the Manitoba chapter of COG- the Organic Food Council of Manitoba ([www.organicfoodcouncil.org](http://www.organicfoodcouncil.org)) Having served as an organic inspector and educator for the last 18 years, I have developed diplomacy, team work and problem solving skills that I believe an effective MLA needs. To be effective in creating positive change in how we rely on our environment we need to problem solve collegeally across municipal, provincial and federal government jurisdictions. The Green Party has the holistic vision to do that effectively.\r\n\r\n**Is there anything in particular you would like to change in our province? In your electoral division?**\r\n\r\nRespect for the demanding roles of food producers needs to increase and our growingly urban population needs to be aware of the importance of local food security and sustainable production, which includes natural resource management\r\npolicies. We need integrated policies on food, energy and water management as these areas impact so mane elements of modern live and have been neglected at a high cost to our collective health and well being.\r\n\r\n**What is one thing you stand for that is not a part of your political party's platform?**\r\n\r\nI would like life to be more like a musical with spontaneous song and dance numbers cheering us up and inspiring us!\r\n\r\n**Do you have any other comments regarding your candidacy?**\r\n\r\nI run a garbage free campaign, no signs or leaflets. I rely on my supporters discussing their values with their friends and collegues- a word of mouth campaign, and expressing the many concerns about the sustainability of modern life so many of us feel, and challenging each other to greater activism to create solutions together.\r\n\r\n**What is your favourite location in the electoral division you are currently a candidate for?**\r\n\r\nI love my home between Pansy and Sarto, Northern Sun Farm Cooperative, our forest and meadows are my favourite\r\nplace to be in the division!

I believe it's more important to run in this election than in the past the more I see the main parties roll out their platforms.  I don't see much choice among them. So I am happy to run as the small guy if only to say \"The emperor has no clothes - this is what we could do as a province instead \".\r\n\r\n**What experience will you bring to compliment your role as MLA?**\r\n\r\nI'm very approachable and people open up to me even when I'm not running.  I can distill legislation and see what it means for the unemployed, working poor, and those who are about to be poor if things don't change.  People in my riding can find out how they will be affected as far as government policy is concerned.\r\n\r\n**Is there anything in particular you would like to change in our province?**\r\n\r\nThat's easy, End Poverty, and start to get to that goal IMMEDIATELY with policies from our party's platform. \r\n\r\n**In your electoral division?**\r\n\r\nEstablish free hot lunch programs in schools, starting in Logan riding schools. Convert slums, abandoned buildings and vacant lots into public housing.  \r\n\r\n**What is one thing you stand for that is not a part of your political party's platform?**\r\n\r\nPublic housing and mixed income housing downtown.

One thing I have heard going door to door in the constiuency is a high degree of voter apathy toward the other parties. The Green Party of Manitoba has innovative ideas and a fresh grasp of politics; I wanted to give my constituents the chance to vote for that. \r\n\r\n**What experience will you bring to compliment your role as MLA?**\r\n\r\nMy experience living abroad and working and advocating in so many different areas will compliment my role as an MLA. From my activities on Parliament Hill to Graduate school in Scotland and travelling Western Europe to being back in Winnipeg and talking to residents of Kirkfield Park I have met so many different people. This is crucial to representing my community in the Manitoba Legislature and being a uniting voice for all of Kirkfield Park. \r\n\r\n**What is your favourite location in the electoral division you are currently a candidate for?**\r\n\r\nMy favourite place in Kirkfield Park is anywhere along Sturgeon Creek. I walk and bike along the Creek all year long starting at the Woodhaven Community Club and either heading East to Assinboine Park or Northwest past Grant's Old Mill along the Sturgeon Creek pathway. I love the red winged Blackbirds that make the Creek their home. ",

      "questionnaire": "**Why did you decide to run in the 2011 Manitoba election?**\r\n\r\nI am running because I am tired of the same old politics of the other major parties. I am a strong believer that the Green Party is the best option for Manitobans as it appears to be the only party that is actively thinking about our future. I believe that sustainability is the key to a healthy Manitoba and that includes a long-lasting plan for the economy, healthcare, crime prevention and the environment. I also want to bring a voice the legislative assembly that isn’t often heard, the voice of the young people of Manitoba.\r\n \r\n**What experience will you bring to compliment your role as MLA?**\r\n\r\nI have lived my entire life in Rossmere and am fully aware of the struggles that affect the people in my area. Such as growing rate of crime which is endangering the safety of our neighbourhoods. Being a member of the community I know that I can be the strong voice that the people of Rossmere need to speak out for what is important to them.\r\n \r\n**Is there anything in particular you would like to change in our province? In your electoral division?**\r\n\r\nIn the electoral district of Rossmere one in six children below the age of six live below the poverty line. I cannot begin to comprehend how this possible in a country as developed as Canada. I believe that it is time for a change in government. A legislature controlled by the Green Party of Manitoba would not stand idly by and watch our children live in poverty. I have always been an advocate for social justice therefore I would do everything in my power to fix this embarrassing situation.\r\n \r\n**What is one thing you stand for that is not a part of your political party's platform?**\r\n\r\nI find that the Green Party has a well round plan for the majority of issues facing Manitobans. Therefore I wanted to highlight a Green value that means a lot to me as a young person. I would like to see more investment in our youth. This means more after school programs to keep children and teenagers out of gangs. It also means taking a second look at our education system and making sure that every Manitoban has access to the best possible education available.\r\n \r\n**What is your favourite location in the electoral division you are currently a candidate for?**\r\n\r\nI would have to say the Fraser Grove Park just off of Kildonan Drive.",

      "questionnaire": "**Why did you decide to run in the 2011 Manitoba election?**\r\n\r\nI decided to run to help the Greens grow and to raise issues of the past ten years that will affect the next 50, that have been completely ignored by the other three parties.  For instance, we have an electoral system that is consistently turning more and more people off, with only the votes of the winner of a seat counting towards seats.  I believe having a numbered 1st-2nd-3rd choice ballot would ensure that only a candidate with 50% of the votes or more would be elected.  Also, we have massive poverty and the erosion of the North End housing stock while half a million dollar homes are being built on what was farmland in Waverley West, extending our city at a great cost to the older, shoulder neighbourhoods along with the core, as our tax dollars continue to pour outwards to build roads, sewers and transit to the edge of town, not to mention maintaining this infrastructure over decades.  Greens would move to redesign our cities to make them more safe, liveable and healthy, and I believe I have some ideas to contribute towards this goal.  We need to start organizing as citizens, bottom-up and not top down.\r\n\r\n**What experience will you bring to compliment your role as MLA?**\r\n\r\nMy various positions in the education field: as an environmental educator for 5th and 6th grade students and as a high school educational assistant have taught me about the virtue of patience and creativity in communication and of the need to include youth in decision-making processes.  We are not fostering a healthy citizenship in youth by repeatedly telling them they are our future leaders - we need them to begin to act as the leaders of today to fill the void created by a generation of visionless politics.  I bring vision and a collaborative approach to organizing that I gained in running a faith based project on ecology, identity and environmental issues in Manitoba, an experience that allowed me to wade into the full religious and cultural diversity of our greater society to create community around our common values and vision for our communities.  My experience living in intentional summer communities as an intern taught me non-violent communication, a skill needed when dealing with a politically diverse population facing grave daily challenges, seeking to vent these challenges upon those associated with the system.  Instead, through patient, compassionate, and active listening, we can learn to include those most on the political and social margins in our collective journey forward.\r\n\r\n**Is there anything in particular you would like to change in our province? In your electoral division?**\r\n\r\nI think citizens should meet to devise a better way to elect MLAs so that all votes count in one way or another, unlike the current first past the post system. I would like to see more democratic space created through regular public forums, so citizens can hear each other and make new connections through which they become more actively self-organizing.  I'd also like to see local citizens committees established around various issues so that people are empowered to tackle community challenges, while being offered small honorariums for their time.  Rather than a one-way communication from the MLA to residents, committee chairs would be communicating directly to their fellow citizens using resources and training provided by the MLA's office.  I would like to see an end to mass poverty in northern Manitoba via programs encouraging greater health in general, but especially among the Aboriginal population facing a major diabetes epidemic.  Child poverty can be eliminated through a universal basic Income, guaranteeing everyone a minimum standard of living without the negative psychological cycle of welfare. Much individual talent and innovation gets lost when individuals struggle to make ends meet, but in the long term the basic income frees people up to invest in their talents and dreams.\r\n\r\n**What is one thing you stand for that is not a part of your political party's platform?**\r\n\r\nI have been convinced that the best way to improve elections is for ballots to include a 1st, 2nd, 3rd choice etc. Called an alternative vote, on the first counting if no candidate has 50% of the 1st place votes, the last place candidate is dropped and those ballots' second choices redistributed.  After this round, either someone is again dropped and their ballots redistributed, or someone has reached 50% and is declared winner.  That someone can control the whole seat under our current system just becasue they have the biggest block of votes - even if it's less than 50% - is the logic of how gangs work, and perhaps explains all the negative attack ads.  With numbered choices you can vote FOR what you want not just against the party you may despise.  Our party officially favours more of a proportional representation model that, through some of the seats being determined through party lists, gives the parties MORE power, but I have come to see that so few citizens are part of parties or of the electoral process, that making elected officials more accountable to local citizens will help build democracy from the ground up rather than the usual top-down 'vote as you're told' disempowering politics now in place.\r\n\r\n**Do you have any other comments regarding your candidacy?**\r\n\r\nI understand many progressive voters fear a PC government, recalling the massive cuts and privatizations by Filmon in the 1990s, and so might vote NDP out of fear and cynicism because of our first past the post system.  If this is you, or if you don't vote because your vote never counts, then let's organize over the next 4 years to change the electoral system. Democracy is being fought for around the world in the streets.  Just because the regime is not disappearing activists or cracking our heads in the streets, we have no reason to assume the democracy we take for granted will endure forever.  Democracy needs to be dynamic and evolving and actively practised or it will become lost, and to some degree - the G20 $1billion police state in Toronto for instance - many of our freedoms have already been eroded, our sovereignty sold out through free trade deals that only benefit the rich.  Isn't it time we collectively confront the free trade globalization ideology that increases the gap between rich and poor and start to vote FOR a vision?  Voting once every 4 years is the least one can do democratically and only a small step towards getting organized as citizens and redefining our common values.\r\n\r\n**What is your favourite location in the electoral division you are currently a candidate for?**\r\n\r\nIt has to be somewhere along the river, likely a little nook at Scotia and Cathedral where you can sit beneath 100 year old trees, watch the moon illuminate the Red, and imagine the history of this country during and before the fur trade when machines could not be heard and the rivers were the main transportation arteries of culture and of the economy.  Honourable mention to the CPR tracks on the western boundary of the riding where I walked many quiet nights growing up in West Kildonan.",

I have a love for the North, and want to do whatever I can to make it the best place that it can possibly be.\r\n\r\n**Is there anything in particular you would like to change in our province?

Everything comes back to proper infrastructure or lack thereof, and until that's dealt with - until everyone in the Flin Flon electoral division has access to potable (clean, safe) drinking water, proper waste disposal, and roads - everything else takes a back seat. Everything is linked.\r\n\r\n**What is one thing you stand for that is not a part of your political party's platform?**\r\n\r\nAll of my core beliefs mesh with party beliefs.\r\n\r\n**Do you have any other comments regarding your candidacy?**\r\n\r\nI’m excited to be the first Green Party candidate in the Flin Flon riding!\r\n\r\n**What is your favourite location in the electoral division you are currently a candidate for?**\r\n\r\nI love driving through the rocks and the lakes between Cranberry Portage and Flin Flon. The natural beauty of the area has appealed to me from the very first time I visited, 15 years ago.",
