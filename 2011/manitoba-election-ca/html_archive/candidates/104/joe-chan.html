<p class='visible_block_when_mobile'>
Joe Chan - Logan
</p>
<p><strong>Why did you decide to run in the 2011 Manitoba election?</strong></p>

<p>Logan is suffering from serious neglect by all the politicians supposedly representing it.  We need someone who has a record of fighting for the people in Logan.  I know the people, my neighbours and friends, and I will make change happen here.</p>

<p><strong>What experience will you bring to compliment your role as MLA?</strong></p>

<p>I have worked for 10 years as Harvey Smith's assistant and during that time I have learned about the complex issues aflicting Logan</p>

<p><strong>Is there anything in particular you would like to change in our province? In your electoral division?</strong></p>

<p>The most important thig to change is the loyalty of elected representatives:  Your elected MLA's FIRST allegiance should be to you the citizens NOT his/her party.  Party politics has undermined democracy at every level in Canada!</p>

<p><strong>What is one thing you stand for that is not a part of your political party's platform?</strong></p>

<p>I agree with everything in my party's platform, but I focus on local issues and people issues right here in Logan.</p>

<p><strong>Do you have any other comments regarding your candidacy?</strong></p>

<p>I try to make few specific promises and prefer to promise working on our common needs and goals through community action and coordinating energy and people in this constituency.</p>

<p><strong>What is your favourite location in the electoral division you are currently a candidate for?</strong></p>

<p>Anywhere I find people, I learn more about what I can do to help.  So the answer is 'Where I meet people!'</p>
