Gerard Allard - St. James
</p>
<p><strong>Why did you decide to run in the 2011 Manitoba election?</strong></p>

<p>I have spent the past 24 years as a City of Winnipeg Police Officer and have witnessed firsthand the challenges that both adults and children face each day. I feel that many Government programs are simply missing the mark when it comes to giving people the tools and support they need to improve their lives long term. I want to work in the Manitoba Legislature to not only assist the residents of St. James with their individual needs but to develop working solutions to large provincial issues like poverty, crime and education. I plan on being a politician who operates with 100% honesty at all times and with a focus on solving issues once and for all.</p>

<p><strong>What experience will you bring to compliment your role as MLA?</strong></p>

<p>I know that St. James is a great neighbourhood but I feel that the area and residents were really neglected by their last MLA. Through my work as a Police Officer and as a single dad, I know that life can be tough at some point for all of us. I want to make sure that people know they can turn to me as their MLA when they need help. I’m committed to being a fulltime MLA and I’m ready to work long hours to meet with constituents on their terms. I can also promise the residents of St. James that as their MLA, I will always remember that I’m working as public servant and that means doing more than cutting ribbons and smiling for photo opportunities.</p>

<p><strong>Is there anything in particular you would like to change in our province? In your electoral division?</strong></p>

<p>The people I’m meeting in St. James are concerned about crime followed by health care and proper supports for seniors. I am also hearing from young parents that they are experiencing a shortage of affordable child care. I don't want parents of young children to have to worry about where they are going to find quality childcare for when they need it. In St. james I am also concerned about the quality of our roads. At a provincial level, I am committed to the prevention of Foetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD). I feel that FASD is one of the major issues that is impacting our ability to prevent and manage crime. I also believe that we have to concentrate on our education system as that is the key to solving so many of today's societal problems and establishing positive building blocks for the future.</p>

<p><strong>What is one thing you stand for that is not a part of your political party's platform?</strong></p>

<p>I believe our government must figure out how they can hold parents accountable for repeated anti-social behaviour by their children. There is no expectation placed on parents for how they parent their children and there is no accountability for parents on how their children behave in the community. This all starts at the Hospital when we first take our kids home with us. We need to inform the parent(s) about their social responsibility and accountability is in raising their child to adulthood and how their actions or non-action will play a role in the childs positive or negative development.</p>

<p><strong>Do you have any other comments regarding your candidacy?</strong></p>

<p>I'm very excited to be running for MLA of St. James. I've just about made it out to every home in the constituency and I can honestly say that St. James residents are some of the nicest people you will ever meet. I think whether I win or not I'll be able to look back and be glad I but my name forward as as candidate for such a great neighbourhood. I am also proud that we ran this campaign from a shoestring budget that focused on door knocking and didn't simply rely an expensive commercial campaign. I am disappointed that no other candidate in St James agreed to a debate. After contacting each of my opponents they both declined my suggestions that we should organize a debate. I believe that the residents of St James or any other electoral division should have that opportunity to see the candidates in action. Elections should be about background, ideas and passion and not just money to run a commercial campaign.</p>

<p><strong>What is your favourite location in the electoral division you are currently a candidate for?</strong></p>

<p>I really enjoy stopping in and grabbing an ice cream at Sargent Sundae then taking a stroll over the Assiniboine Park footbridge. I also like the Red Boot Drive-in next to my campaign office: great burgers!</p>
