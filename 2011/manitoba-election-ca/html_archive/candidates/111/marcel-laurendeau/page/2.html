<p class='visible_block_when_mobile'>
Marcel Laurendeau - St. Norbert
</p>
<p><strong>Why did you decide to run in the 2011 Manitoba election?</strong></p>

<p>My primary decision for running in this election was to ensure strong representation for my constituency of St. Norbert and to make improvements to services provided to the citizens of Manitoba.  I also believe that we must make some significant changes in how government conducts business in order to ensure future generations of Manitobans have a secure future.</p>

<p><strong>What experience will you bring to compliment your role as MLA?</strong></p>

<p>I have served as both a City of Winnipeg Councillor (two years) and as a provincial MLA from 1990 to 2003.  I also have experience as an independent business owner, firstly of a Petro Canada service station and for the past eight years as a real estate agent for Century 21.</p>

<p><strong>Is there anything in particular you would like to change in our province?  In your electoral division?</strong></p>

<p>I would like to ensure that the citizens of Manitoba have more confidence in their government and their local MLAs.  We also need to ensure that the government appropriately adapts to the changing needs of our citizens.  For example, we know that we have an aging population and we need to better plan for the future needs of baby boomers.  We also need to get a handle, once and for all, on the escalating crime rate in our province.  To do that we must focus on better educating our young people; ensuring they have access to a broad range of evening, weekend and summer activities; and we must work collaboratively with police and community members, to put a stop to increasing gang activity in our cities and communities.  We must ensure we implement measures to prevent crime, at the same time we need to ensure we deal promptly and effectively with convicted criminals and send a strong message that criminal activity will not be tolerated in Manitoba.  We must focus on better supporting families and strengthening communities.  In St. Norbert Constituency, we also have a very diverse population and must better understand the needs of a wide variety of ethnic communities, new immigrants, youth and seniors.</p>

<p><strong>What is one thing you stand for that is not part of your political party’s platform?</strong></p>

<p>I believe that the provincial government in Manitoba must work more closely and collaboratively with businesses and cities, towns and municipalities.  I personally would like to see a significant improvement to the amount of red tape that businesses must go through when dealing with government.  Also, I have long advocated for changing the legislation to allow farmer’s markets to be open more days during the week and to study the feasibility of making the St. Norbert Farmer’s Market a year-round facility.</p>

<p><strong>Do you have any other comments regarding your candidacy?</strong></p>

<p>I would just like to say that as a lifelong resident of this community and constituency, I have an excellent understanding of the area demographics and needs.  I also have a proven track record as both a City Councillor and MLA of getting things done in the community and of standing up for the residents of my community.</p>

<p><strong>What is your favourite location in the electoral division you are currently a candidate for?</strong></p>

<p>In addition to my own backyard, my favourite location has to be any of the wonderful parks and walking trails throughout our community, including our own St. Norbert Art Centre located on the Trappistes Monastery site.</p>
