Harry Wolbert - St. Vital
</p>
<p><strong>Why did you decide to run in the 2011 Manitoba election?</strong></p>

<p>I have decided to once again run as a candidate because I don’t like the direction in which our province is heading. I want to be a champion for positive social change in my community and my province.</p>

<p><strong>What experience will you bring to compliment your role as MLA?</strong></p>

<p>I will bring my 21 years of experience as an advocate and counselor in the social services field, as well as my experience in policy development to the Manitoba Legislature. As an advocate for social justice issues, one of my goals has been the inclusion and full-citizenship of all Manitobans.</p>

<p><strong>Is there anything in particular you would like to change in our province? In your electoral division?</strong></p>

<p>Yes. Currently, there are four groups (the aboriginal community, the poor, university students, persons with disabilities) which have traditionally not participated in our political process. I would like to engage these groups to become more active participants in our society. I am a strong believer in empowering individuals and communities to participate in society as “responsible citizens” and not just as taxpayers.</p>

<p><strong>What is one thing you stand for that is not part of your political party’s platform?</strong></p>

<p>Provincial accessibility legislation for persons with disabilities. I believe that accessibility is a right.</p>

<p><strong>Do you have any other comments regarding your candidacy?</strong></p>

<p>My commitment to you: 1) Reduce the tax burden on all Manitobans 2) Eliminate the “job-killing” payroll tax which weakens our economy 3) Make crime and neighbourhood safety a priority 4) Deal with some of the social and root causes of crime such as poverty, homelessness and gangs 5) Lower the high school drop-out rates and reduce classroom overcrowding 6) Support Manitoba’s green economy and environmentally friendly initiatives</p>

<p><strong>What is your favourite location in the electoral division you are currently a candidate for?</strong></p>

<p>I have a couple of favourites. They would be the St. Vital Shopping Centre and the Village Canadien Housing Co-op., where my wife Valerie and I have been involved in the community since 2001.</p>
