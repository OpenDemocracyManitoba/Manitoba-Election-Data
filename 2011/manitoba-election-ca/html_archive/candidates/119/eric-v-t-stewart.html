Eric V. T. Stewart - Wolseley
</p>
<p><strong>Why did you decide to run in the 2011 Manitoba election?</strong></p>

<p>I am involved with a number of community organizations and felt the real need to be “an advocate for our community in government, rather than a advocate for government in our community” which has been the complaint I've heard most about the incumbent. I really don't like the generic programing that the NDP spit out and expect to work the same in every area. We need government programs to be flexible to meet various needs.</p>

<p><strong>What experience will you bring to compliment your role as MLA?</strong></p>

<p>I have B.A. &amp; an M.A. in Economics so I understand theory, I own my own business in the area so I get the practical and I live in the area and sit on the boards of: West Broadway Biz, West Broadway Development Corporation, &amp; Westminister United so I am a part of the community. I bring a range of experience and energy from the area to work on the real issues in the area.</p>

<p><strong>Is there anything in particular you would like to change in our province? In your electoral division?</strong></p>

<p>There are a couple of provincial things</p>

<ul>
<li><p>People should be able to live on their pay cheques, but the NDP just keep raising the minimum wage which only raises costs for everybody. The smarter solution is to raise the basic personal income tax exemption amount. The current exemption amount in Manitoba is $8,384, which is less than 60% of the $14,535 exemption amount in Saskatchewan. I think people want to keep more of their pay cheque.</p></li>
<li><p>I want to make sure tax dollars strengthen our community rather than increase red tape that hampers government transparency. The current spending by NDP is over $10-million a year on advertising. Liberals propose eliminating advertising for government services without competition and restricting it to essential information only.
In our community – which is made up of West Broadway, Armstrong Point, Assiniboine, the West End and Wolseley- in other words “the early suburbs”, there are a huge need to deal with the ageing infrastructure and the city can't fix it alone. We need to develop longer-term partnerships to deal with it rather than one-off projects that patch one spot at a time.</p></li>
</ul>


<p><strong>What is one thing you stand for that is not a part of your political party's platform?</strong></p>

<p>Well I'm running because I feel the incumbent is more of a spokesman for his party than an advocate for the area so things that are area issues like supporting small business initiatives protecting the green canopy, riverbank stabilization, and housing initiatives that fit with the neighbourhood that has had “a lot of talk but only a little done” would a priority. I'd put the community first and the party second.</p>

<p><strong>Do you have any other comments regarding your candidacy?</strong></p>

<p>It is important to me that people participate – “if I can't get your vote, at least I can get you to vote” is a bit of a motto for me. It bothers me when I hear somebody say “I never vote”, politics should be an opportunity for people to show that they care not a nuisance to be avoided.</p>

<p><strong>What is your favourite location in the electoral division you are currently a candidate for?</strong></p>

<p>I really like the river walk between Cornish and the Osborne Street bridge. It is a great place and I've taken some of my favourite pictures there.</p>
