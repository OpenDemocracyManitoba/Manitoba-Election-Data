Troy Osiname - Seine River
</p>
<p><strong>Why did you decide to run in the 2011 Manitoba election?</strong></p>

<p>I have decided to run for office because I firmly believe that you and your children need an active voice to lead from a reference point of passion and responsibility. The type of change I seek should quickly effect education, healthy active living, social justice, and crime. I know the time is now. I feel that it is very necessary for young people to grab the torch that is being passed to us. It's up to us to take this responsibility seriously and, regardless of what we are passionate about (e.g., politics, business, community), we have begin to think of conventional and unconventional methods to encourage progress. My campaign slogan, N4N, reminds all of us that we must act NOW to change our communities and usher in that change with NEW ideas and energy.</p>

<p><strong>What experience will you bring to compliment your role as MLA?</strong></p>

<p>I have worked as a youth care worker for the past 5 years. In 2009, I founded a community organization called Community Vibes Incorporated. Through this group, I have been involved in planning forums related to crime and safety as well as engaging youth and young professionals in their communities. The Community Vibes Cook Out event in Central Park (June 2010 and 2011) has also been an important piece to bringing the community and business together while encouraging cultural understanding and civic pride.</p>

<p><strong>Is there anything in particular you would like to change in our province? In your electoral division?</strong></p>

<p>In Manitoba and in Seine River, politics needs revitalization. Young people need to become more engaged and those from previous generations also need a voice and feel a sense of respect. I feel I am the best candidate to bring these together and transform the area and our province. Also, particularly in Seine River, access to affordable daycare needs to be addressed as well as the promotion of health and physical activity for young and old alike.</p>

<p><strong>Do you have any other comments regarding your candidacy?</strong></p>

<p>I urge all voters in Seine River to make an informed choice. Find out about me and my ideas at <a href="http://www.now4new.ca">www.now4new.ca</a>. I look forward to meeting you all.</p>
