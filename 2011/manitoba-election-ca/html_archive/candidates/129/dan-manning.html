Dan Manning - River Heights
</p>
<p><strong>Why did you decide to run in the 2011 Manitoba election?</strong></p>

<p>I know what brings young people to Manitoba and it is the forward movement of the NDP that has made Manitoba attractive and stronger for families.</p>

<p><strong>What experience will you bring to compliment your role as MLA?</strong></p>

<p>Married to a life-long River Heights girl and know the issues facing our community.  A trusted advocate, I can effectively bring concerns to government and make change.</p>

<p><strong>Is there anything in particular you would like to change in our province? In your electoral division?</strong></p>

<p>Daycare accessibility, education funding, maintaining the arts and music community, supporting our students, keeping our lakes healthy and province green.</p>
