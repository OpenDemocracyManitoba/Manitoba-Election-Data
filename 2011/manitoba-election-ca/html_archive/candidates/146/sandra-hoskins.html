Sandra Hoskins - Dawson Trail
</p>
<p><strong>Why did you decide to run in the 2011 Manitoba election?</strong></p>

<p>Three years ago, my daughter contacted Gary Doer, Theresa Oswald, Hugh McFayden and Jon Gerrard with a request for help. Jon Gerrard was the only politician who responded. Jon helped us navigate the health care system to have my daughter placed on the waiting list for a double hip transplant. Six months later, my daughter had both her hips replaced one week apart. It fundamentally changed her life. From this experience, I have learned that one person can make a significant difference in the lives of others. I am running to make a difference for the voters in Dawson Trail.</p>

<p><strong>What experience will you bring to compliment your role as MLA?</strong></p>

<p>In my current position, I am a project manager and educator.  In my role as a project manager, I am used to working on timelines with tight budgets to meet specific objectives.  As a project manager, my most valuable assets are my team members.  I will use the same philosophy to build a cohesive team of voters from all parties that will serve as my mentors and advisors in Dawson Trail.  I know that I don’t have all the answers.  However, just like all the projects that I have worked on, I know that the people in my electoral division can be part of the solution.</p>

<p><strong>Is there anything in particular you would like to change in our province? In your electoral division?</strong></p>

<p>I would like to have our province viewed as a sum of its parts.  We have urban, rural and northern areas with very different areas and concerns.  I would like to see a comprehensive Manitoba-centric strategy for leveraging the strengths of voters and their families.  It is time to develop a vision of our province in 10 years, 20 years and 30 years – 4 year increments isn’t working right now.</p>

<p><strong>What is one thing you stand for that is not a part of your political party's platform?</strong></p>

<p>To a large degree, I agree with the overarching platform or I won’t be running as a candidate for the Liberal Party.  I am a proponent of lifespan learning programs.  I think that families and individuals should have access to an education strategy that encompasses early childhood through retirement.  For example:  We need to offer more online degree programs such as MBAs so that individuals in rural and northern areas are able to continue to their education without having to travel to centers such as Winnipeg and Brandon.</p>

<p><strong>Do you have any other comments regarding your candidacy?</strong></p>

<p>I would ask all voters to vote.  Whether you support a specific party or decline your ballot, vote. Your vote is your voice.  Be heard.</p>

<p><strong>What is your favourite location in the electoral division you are currently a candidate for?</strong></p>

<p>It would be my home.</p>
