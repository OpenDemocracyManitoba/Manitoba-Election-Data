Darcy Linklater - Flin Flon
</p>
<p><strong>Why did you decide to run in the 2011 Manitoba election?</strong></p>

<p>The Opportunity presented itself from the Progressive Conservative Party of Manitoba to run in the 2011 elections for the Flin Flon Riding. After careful consideration and reviewing the PC’s Principals and Policies and the encouragement from the People of Nisichawayasihk Cree Nation I decided I would run as I had an interest in local politics at early age as my Father has been in Council for 20 years and I have seen the hard work and sacrifices he has committed for the People of NCN and I feel that I can represent the communities within the Flin Flon Riding, and have a voice for them, so that they can be apart of the Government in Power.</p>

<p><strong>What experience will you bring to compliment your role as MLA?</strong></p>

<p>I obtained my Business Administration Diploma with a Major in Management and I am currently enrolled in Financial Management Accounting through distance education with the University of Manitoba. I am currently employed as the Contract &amp; Financial Administrator for our Wuskwatim Implementation Office where I display strong work ethics, professionalism and accountability. I am also a Trustee for NCN Taskinigahp Trust and a Board of Director for NCN Parks &amp; Recreation. I strongly believe that these work experiences that I am currently involved in as well as the education I am pursuing have given me experience to compliment me as a MLA.</p>

<p><strong>Is there anything in particular you would like to change in our province? In your electoral division?</strong></p>

<p>I have seen the neglect from the Provincial Government in Power with regards to Northern Issues in the Flin Flon Riding such as: Education, Health Care, Infrastructure, Child and Family Services, Housing, Roads, Crime, Poverty etc… Lac Brochet, Brochet and Tadoule Lake don’t even have Hydro Electric Power and they are only accessible by airway and winter road. It is time that these issues are looked at seriously as these communities are a part of our Great Province of Manitoba.</p>

<p><strong>What is one thing you stand for that is not a part of your political party's platform?</strong></p>

<p>I agree with the Principals and Policies of the Progressive Conservative Party, so I cannot think of anything I stand for that is not party of the PC Platform.</p>

<p><strong>Do you have any other comments regarding your candidacy?</strong></p>

<p>With regards to my candidacy I would like to see the voter turn increase in the Flin Flon Riding as the last election saw a low voter turn out through out the whole riding. I especially want to see the Aboriginal Voter turn out to Increase significantly. I want them to get involved, to come out and vote and change the statistics.</p>

<p><strong>What is your favourite location in the electoral division you are currently a candidate for?</strong></p>

<p>NCN is my Favorite location in my electoral division as I grew up here; however the whole Flin Flon Riding is a wonderful place, with our Natural Resources and Beautiful Environment Surroundings.</p>
