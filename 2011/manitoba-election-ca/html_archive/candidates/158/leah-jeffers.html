<p class='visible_block_when_mobile'>
Leah Jeffers - Midland
</p>
<p><strong>Why did you decide to run in the 2011 Manitoba election?</strong></p>

<p>I really like what the Liberal party wants to do for Manitoba. Their
platform is focused on families and ways to improve their lives. I
also think its important for younger people to involved in the
political system and have really enjoyed the opportunity.</p>

<p><strong>What experience will you bring to compliment your role as MLA?</strong></p>

<p>I  know that I am not as experienced as my opposition but would do my
best at representing the people of Midland. I would work very hard to
make sure their voices were heard and brought forward. I grew up in
Graysville and know the concerns and issues of living in such rural
areas.</p>

<p><strong>Is there anything in particular you would like to change in our province? In your electoral division?</strong></p>

<p>There are a lot of things that need to be updated and improved. Health
care system needs to work better for patients and there needs to be
more work done with early child hood education and opening up day care
spots. Crime and violence rates are really high and that needs to be
improved. And, there is a lot of poverty though out the province and
that needs to be addressed.</p>

<p><strong>What is your favourite location in the electoral division you are currently a candidate for?</strong></p>

<p>The area is huge and there are so many beautiful places that I enjoy
spending time in. The Pembina Valley is gorgeous and a great place to
hike around in.</p>
