Lee Fehler - Steinbach
</p>
<p><strong>Why did you decide to run in the 2011 Manitoba election?</strong></p>

<p>I am running in this campaign as I have been concerned about the direction of Steinbach and all our communities during these periods of high growth. I recently ran in the municipal campaign in Steinbach, concerned primarily about issues such as crime and addictions prevention in our city, as well as addressing the issues that have come with rapid growth. As a lifelong resident of Steinbach I want to see these periods of prosperity continue and make sure that we are being proactive in dealing with the issues facing us today and tomorrow. It is my belief that our riding has been neglected by our current government and I have a belief that we can do things better in our communities.</p>

<p><strong>What experience will you bring to compliment your role as MLA?</strong></p>

<p>My recent experience as a candidate for Steinbach City Council gave me an opportunity to listen to the residents of Steinbach and hear many of the concerns addressing all of us. It also allowed me to meet and communicate with members of our current city council so I understand the issues affecting not only our local citizens but also at the municipal government level. I am a relatively new face to the political scene in the area but this also allows me to distance myself from some old trends that have not worked and to hopefully bring some new ideas to the table.</p>

<p><strong>Is there anything in particular you would like to change in our province? In your electoral division?</strong></p>

<p>I am tired of the polarized politics that have always left parts of our province in the dark and out of the provincial government’s eye. North versus south, urban versus rural, these trends have gotten Manitoba nowhere over the last two decades and the last two governments. If we work together as a province we can stop the interprovincial migration losses and work together to once again put Manitoba forward as a prosperous “have” province.</p>

<p>Locally I still find the issues of crime and addictions prevention to be very important. This was a much talked about issue in the 2010 municipal campaign and I would love to make sure that the front line services in Steinbach have the appropriate resources they need to combat this. The communities in the riding are all growing rapidly however and there are many issues to address. It is important that we elect a government that is prepared to no longer ignore our communities and brings a solid platform to address the issues of high growth.</p>

<p><strong>What is one thing you stand for that is not a part of your political party's platform?</strong></p>

<p>I find that some of the environmental laws in our province are quite appalling. One issue I would like to address is whether or not we should continue to allow logging and mining in our provincial parks. It is my belief that provincial parks should be set aside to preserve these areas for future generations and for recreation. Instead, I believe that logging and mining should be set aside for provincial forests which are intended for these uses.</p>

<p><strong>Do you have any other comments regarding your candidacy?</strong></p>

<p>I am so happy to be a young candidate in a rapidly growing area. My goal here is to not only represent the historical issues and people in our riding but also bring some new ideas and represent the changing face of our riding as well. Together we can make our communities and safer and more prosperous place to live for all.</p>

<p><strong>What is your favourite location in the electoral division you are currently a candidate for?</strong></p>

<p>While I do have many favourite locations I would have to say that I love riding my road bicycle. As such I have a route that takes me from Steinbach, up the 52 highway and then loops through Kleefeld and back down Ridge Road to Steinbach. This covers the whole of my riding and I enjoy the relaxing and wonderful view of the entire area as I travel these roads.</p>
