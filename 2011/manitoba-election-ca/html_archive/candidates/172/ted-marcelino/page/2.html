<p class='visible_block_when_mobile'>
Ted Marcelino - Tyndall Park
</p>
<p><strong>Why did you decide to run in the 2011 Manitoba election?</strong></p>

<p>I grew up seeing my father, who was a political leader in the village, holding and presiding over meetings of the caucus of elders. To hear and see animated debates among the elders that linger on for hours was a scene that was both fascinating and inspiring. To me, serving the people is the greatest honour that could be bestowed upon a person.</p>

<p><strong>What experience will you bring to compliment your role as MLA?</strong></p>

<p>My personal life experience serves as my guide as well as a constant resource in providing advice and counsel to numerous friends and acquaintances. My legal training as well has prepared me for helping advocate for the issues that I have volunteered to participate in. I have always committed unconditionally to giving the best of myself in doing what is right with neither fear nor favour.</p>

<p><strong>Is there anything in particular you would like to change in our province? In your electoral division?</strong></p>

<p>I will make sure that we add to, not subtract from, the current affordable housing programs that were initiated by the NDP. I will ensure that our focus on preserving and expanding health care remains.</p>
