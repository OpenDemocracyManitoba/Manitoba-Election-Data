Murray Cliff - Arthur-Virden
</p>
<p><strong>Why did you decide to run in the 2011 Manitoba election?</strong></p>

<p>This is my third approach to the legislature. I got involved early with the Conservatives and was the candidate in Radisson until Stuart Murray fired Steven Fletcher via email so I approached the Liberals and ran in 2004 &amp; 2007 in Radisson.</p>

<p>I have successfully ran in two civic elections and one provincial election without spending a tax payer penny. I want to win a sizable area without money to show how ludicrous the whole system is and to have no hidden agendas or owe any favors.  I want to show tomorrows youth that they do not need money to run for office and restore faith in the political world.</p>

<p><strong>What experience will you bring to compliment your role as MLA?</strong></p>

<p>I have been a contract salesman for over twenty years. I have sold to and have worked with original equipment manufacturer to suppliers to process to farmers to office workers and have an excellent skill of listening for the language of needs. I am very passionate in getting the very best value for all for the best market price in the best time so this would compliment my roll as MLA and would give great value and benefits to all the voters.</p>

<p><strong>Is there anything in particular you would like to change in our province? In your electoral division?</strong></p>

<p>Yes, I would like to remove the payroll tax and reduce the provincial sales tax to six and split it with the business owner and move the minimum wage to twelve dollars to kick start the economy. If you drive safely for the year the provincial government should pay for your license as this would save millions in property damage ...we should address the over bloated WRHA and open up the kitchens in all the hospitals.</p>

<p>The electoral area should stay the same.</p>

<p><strong>What is one thing you stand for that is not a part of your political party's platform?</strong></p>

<p>The first nation demographic shift is being totally ignored here in Manitoba. I met a chief from Northern Saskatchewan in Saskatoon and I asked him what and how can we help. He told me that every time they would approach Ottawa or Regina they would get out there cheque book... this is how we deal with the shift...we need to approach them and work towards a better future for all Manitoba people including first nations. Work and establish strategies for a better relationship and future and understand there language of needs.</p>

<p><strong>Do you have any other comments regarding your candidacy?</strong></p>

<p>I am running in a Conservative stronghold and want to offer the voters a alternative to the current boring, self-centered and egotistical Conservatives. I offer a clean slate with no relationships and no hidden agenda’s and without electing me the voters of Arthur Virden have already saved over twenty thousand dollars for implementing my zero penny campaign. I am ambitious and committed to listening to all the language of needs and will be ready for what the oil industry and first nations dicate.</p>

<p><strong>What is your favourite location in the electoral division you are currently a candidate for?</strong></p>

<p>This is by far the most difficult question. The entire electoral division is amazing in size and beauty. The place that I remember with the sun going down just south of Pipestone on highway 83...</p>
