Carl Hyde - Riding Mountain
</p>
<p><strong>Why did you decide to run in the 2011 Manitoba election?</strong></p>

<p>I first became active with the Manitoba Liberal Party in the summer of 2010, after winning a scholarship from them upon my graduation from Shoal Lake School. Over the course of the ensuing year, I remained active with the party. Upon being contacted for the purpose of running in mid-August, I realized that the opportunity to run for public office is one that few people have the chance to experience in their lifetime. Running in an election is a wonderful experience to interact with one's electoral division, and really learn about the people that live there.</p>

<p><strong>What experience will you bring to complement your role as MLA?</strong></p>

<p>I grew up entirely in rural Manitoba, on my parents' farm outside of Shoal Lake. I still enjoy a strong family connection with the people of my home division. As well, through studying and living in Winnipeg, I have developed an understanding of the challenges and issues facing urban life in Manitoba as well. Legislation in Manitoba needs to take into account both sides of this important coin, and I believe that the dual lives I have lived will allow me to see both perspectives on divisive issues. As well, my family connections in the area allow me to constantly stay up to date on the issues facing the rural residents of the province.</p>

<p><strong>Is there anything in particular that you want to change about our province? In your electoral division?</strong></p>

<p>I think that Manitoba deserves more respect on the national scale than it currently gets. Out diversified economic approach has created a strong economy that can not only survive times of trouble, it can thrive in them. I think that other provinces need to look at our model and see the long-term success that we have created, instead of the short-term gains that seem so desirable. Manitoba is poised to become a "have" province, one of the strongest in the new Canada, and it is time for the rest of the country to realize it and give us the proper respect.</p>

<p><strong>What is one thing you stand for that is not a part of your political party's platform?</strong></p>

<p>I think that the moratorium on school closures in Manitoba is a policy that requires definite re-evaluation. The problem is complex, and a "one case fits all" approach is not going to act in anybody's best interest. When a school is being considered for closure, we must insure that the arguments of all interested parties are heard, and that the need for efficiency in administration and funding is balanced against our duty to provide the highest-quality and most convenient education to the children of this province. In this way, I would take a long, hard, look at the moratorium policy before making a decision to preserve such an ideal.</p>

<p><strong>Do you have any other comments regarding your candidacy?</strong></p>

<p>Though myself and my campaign team are running this particular campaign as a low-key affair, we are optimistic about our chances in this election. This may be my first time running in the political arena, but we believe that I can offer a fresh perspective and energy that has been lacking in the provincial political sphere here for rather a long time. We urge all of the voters in this election to take the time to examine the issues as they stand, and determine their opinion of them. Then, vote for the candidate that best represents what you want from the provincial government.</p>

<p><strong>What is your favourite location in the electoral division that you are currently a candidate for?</strong></p>

<p>My favourite place will always be at home on the family farm, with the rest of my family. Even on a cold winter's morning, when the barn needs to be shovelled out, or a hot summer afternoon when a bin needs to be shovelled out, I would not rather be anywhere else.</p>
