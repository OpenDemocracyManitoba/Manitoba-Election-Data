Janelle Mailhot - Morris
</p>
<p><strong>Why did you decide to run in the 2011 Manitoba election?</strong></p>

<p>I’ve been so frustrated with past governments’ neglect of important community issues that I decided to run in 2007 and 2011.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, I am only able to campaign part-time. My campaign is fuelled entirely by my desire to make positive changes in Manitoba, and I do what I can outside of my regular work hours.</p>

<p><strong>What experience will you bring to compliment your role as MLA?</strong></p>

<p>In my spare time, I am a musician, writer and videographer. My role - in every aspect of my life - is to inspire. We haven’t seen any spark of inspiration in Canadian politics for a very long time, and it is just what’s needed to bring everyone together and bring positive change in Manitoba.</p>

<p>The current government has become satisfied with the status quo and fails to provide a vision where Manitobans can become the very best.</p>

<p><strong>Is there anything in particular you would like to change in our province? In your electoral division?</strong></p>

<p>In my electoral division, my focus is on the need of financial and social supports for our communities to thrive. A few examples are providing access to quality health care for those who can no longer commute to cities, ensuring our elderly have proper supports to stay in the communities they helped build, as well as providing new industry so new families can choose to plant roots in rural areas.</p>

<p>In regards to my vision for Manitoba, I see our province running solely on renewable energy sources, other than hydro-electricity. Through investments in research and development, over time we can transition our communities and cities to using geo-thermal, solar and wind power, then - keeping Manitoba Hydro public – sell our hydro-electricity to neighbouring provinces and states.</p>

<p><strong>What is one thing you stand for that is not a part of your political party's platform?</strong></p>

<p>I agree with the Liberal Party’s platform, which is why I chose to run as a Liberal candidate. The Manitoba Liberal focus is on research, prevention and innovation; particularly in growing a sustainable economy, ensuring everyone has access quality health care, and providing all Manitobans with the best education at every level.</p>

<p><strong>Do you have any other comments regarding your candidacy?</strong></p>

<p>Every candidate wants to improve the quality of life for every Manitoban; we just have different ideas of what needs to be done to get there. My ideas are new and refreshing, especially to those who’ve been consistently disappointed in the lack of results from past governments. Voters are just as eager as I am to see actual improvements, and the Liberal platform provides achievable solutions.</p>

<p>My strong family roots in the Morris riding and my innovative vision for the future of our rural communities are just a few reasons to vote for me.<br/>
Should you vote for me, you would be choosing a young, passionate and fierce MLA. An adequate amount of time and an idealistic desire with unwavering drive are necessary characteristics for your representative to possess in order to build long-term sustainable improvements in our communities.</p>

<p><strong>What is your favourite location in the electoral division you are currently a candidate for?</strong></p>

<p>When I try to choose, I am touched by so many wonderful memories. My friends and family live in most of these communities, and each town is meaningful to me.</p>
