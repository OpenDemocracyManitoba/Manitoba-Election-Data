Harold Dyck - Minto
</p>
<p><strong>Why did you decide to run in the 2011 Manitoba election?</strong></p>

<p>I have been long frustrated by the failure of both the current and     previous provincial governments to deal effectively with the real issues of Winnipeg’s inner city. I believe it is time that inner city residents had a voice in the legislature that puts their issues first, that speaks for them and their concerns, and not the party that controls their vote. I am pledged to be that kind of voice in the legislature, as I have done my whole life.</p>

<p>   I am also of the firm belief that we all face a growing environmental   crisis that none of the major parties are effectively dealing with. I have decided to run for the Green Party as the party most dedicated and best equipped to solving that crisis. If we fail to do so, for ourselves and future generations, then solutions to any other problems become meaningless. I also believe that the environment and the fight for social and economic fairness and justice for all are directly linked.</p>

<p><strong>What experience will you bring to compliment your role as MLA?</strong></p>

<p>For the past 12 years, I have worked as an anti– poverty advocate for the Manitoba Low Income Intermediary Project, helping thousands of low income individuals and families resolve problems with various government and private agencies and find needed resources in the community.</p>

<p>I am also employed  part time  by Winnipeg Harvest, working on  advocacy, research, and public education issues.</p>

<p>I have served for several years on the Board of Directors of the Social Planning Council of Winnipeg, as a tenants representative on the Residential Tenancies Appeal Commission and on an advisory committee to the Minister on the Residential Tenancies Act. I am an active participant in the Make Poverty History Manitoba coalition, Winnipeg Poverty Advocacy Network, and numerous other organizations.</p>

<p>I have worked in construction, in factories, and as a Workplace Safety and Health Inspector for the Province of Manitoba, and managed a bookstore.  I have been a union activist with the Canadian Autoworkers Union and the Manitoba Government Employees Union, repeatedly elected as shop steward and to local and regional leadership positions. Wherever I have worked, I have always been an activist for social justice.</p>

<p><strong>Is there anything in particular you would like to change in our province? In your electoral division?</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>Massive public investment to build affordable, quality housing for all.</p></li>
<li><p>A provincial food security initiative  to ensure the nutrition needs of all our citizens are met while ensuring the economic security of the family farmer.</p></li>
<li><p>Effective crime reduction through prevention, including expansion of community sports, recreational, and educational programs and supports for our youth, to keep  them off the  streets and out of gangs.</p></li>
<li><p>Better and lower cost health care through prevention, including nutritional supports, expanded public health education and community programs, and community fitness  centres.</p></li>
<li><p>Making Manitoba a true leader in solving our environmental crisis, through massive investment in public transit to reduce carbon emissions and dependency on fossil  fuels, elimination of practices and economic policies that result in the poisoning  of our air and water supplies, massive investment using Manitoba  Hydro profits to make all our homes and workplaces energy efficient instead of building new, environmentally damaging  mega-dams, and research and development of alternative low  impact energy production.</p></li>
<li><p>Meaningful, long term job creation through training and  employment placement of  local citizens to meet the demands of our programs listed above.</p></li>
</ul>


<p><strong>What is one thing you stand for that is not a part of your political party's platform?</strong></p>

<p>One of the overriding issues in Minto and throughout our inner city is poverty. It is one of the biggest factors driving up health care costs, while at the same time the level of front line preventative care and treatment is declining. This is aggravated by the establishment of numerous high volume, excessively profitable private walk in clinics that provide poor levels of service. I would advocate for the establishment of a number of inner city poverty health centres similar to Mount Carmel Clinic to more adequately service the health needs of our population.</p>

<p><strong>Do you have any other comments regarding your candidacy?</strong></p>

<p>We are a new, young, and growing political force in Manitoba. I am proud to be affiliated with a movement that is taking the lead in this election in placing the environment and social and economic justice, based on a sound economic program, at the forefront in this election. Green voices in our legislature will change the political face of Manitoba for the better. I invite all voters to learn more about us at my website at <a href="http://www.harolddyck.com">www.harolddyck.com</a>, ot the Green Party site at <a href="http://www.greenparty.mb.ca">www.greenparty.mb.ca</a>.</p>

<p><strong>What is your favourite location in the electoral division you are currently a candidate for?</strong></p>

<p>It is difficult to focus on one thing because there are so many great features in Minto, but I do particularly like the expansion of the University of Winnipeg, at the very edge of the riding, as an institution servicing many of the needs of Winnipeg's west end and downtown.</p>
