Tamela Friesen - Dauphin
</p>
<p><strong>Why did you decide to run in the 2011 Manitoba election?</strong></p>

<p>While I have a great life, I know that some of my neighbours are struggling, such as my low-income, Anishinabe neighbours. Now that I know what some of my neighbours are up against, and their challenges are largely caused by policy, I have to act to remove any and all policy barriers. Some policies benefit me at the expense of my neighbour, i.e., I pay low taxes but apparently too low, because our government does not have enough money to ensure affordable housing for all. It is not good enough that most of us in our country have it pretty good while some of us struggle. There is enough for everyone and I want to work for equal access to economy, culture, and political power for every person.</p>

<p><strong>What experience will you bring to compliment your role as MLA?</strong></p>

<p>I am a small "p" philosopher, small "t" theologian, and keenly interested in our community story. In short, my analytical brain can bring a new way of thinking and problem-solving to the table. This is my approach to community-building through politics:</p>

<ol>
<li>Understand that we, people in the community, know our strengths and our challenges best and that we have the wisdom, resources, people, and co-operation to meet any challenges.</li>
<li>Understand that, given the chance, neighbours have good intentions toward one another, believe the best about one another, and like to see the best for one another.</li>
<li>Understand that the current way we do democracy no longer adequately reflects the complexity and diversity of our community and that we need to change this immediately—then we can access our ALL community strengths to meet all our community challenges.</li>
<li>Understand that the solutions to our challenges must inherently attend to the needs of our current community as well as future generations and; therefore, must be fiscally and environmentally responsible.</li>
<li>Understand that when you fight poverty, you fight illness, fight mental illness, fight domestic abuse, fight demoralized workforce syndrome, fight crime, fight hunger, fight elevated high-school drop-out rates, fight an inadequate tax base, fight gang participation</li>
</ol>


<p><strong>Is there anything in particular you would like to change in our province? In your electoral division?</strong></p>

<p>It is absolutely imperative that we re-engage our neighbours in politics. The voter turn out is unacceptably low and it is actually a crisis of democracy. A disengaged population is one easily abused and misrepresented by government. A disengaged population makes it easy for governments to simply pander to corporate interests, to equate “economy” with “what’s good for people”, to ignore our more vulnerable neighbours. A disengaged population will get exactly what they expect from government, and worse. We need to muster the political will to modernize our democracy to reflect the complexity of our times, i.e., introduce proportional representation, for one.</p>

<p><strong>What is one thing you stand for that is not a part of your political party's platform?</strong></p>

<p>The nice thing about the Green Party is that it is still by the people for the people, it hasn't turned into a machine in a rut that shuts down new and independent thinking. Greens are welcome to bring any idea to the table, it's more about a general approach to community building and as such, it's very easy for voters to fit in. We've policies that attract traditionally conservative, liberal, and ndp voters and those who do not usually vote.</p>

<p><strong>Do you have any other comments regarding your candidacy?</strong></p>

<p>I enjoy meeting my neighbours and hearing about what matters to them. I learn something new in each conversation and deepen my appreciation for our diversity and beauty.</p>

<p><strong>What is your favourite location in the electoral division you are currently a candidate for?</strong></p>

<p>Actually, the Dauphin Constituency is one of the most beautiful places I know. It's the reason we moved to the area five years ago ... it's an outdoor wonderland without the droves of people. My favorite highway bicycle ride is number five between Roblin and Grandview. For off-road riding, any of the back roads will do!</p>
