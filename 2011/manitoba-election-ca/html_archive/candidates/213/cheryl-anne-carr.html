Cheryl-Anne Carr - Minto
</p>
<p><strong>Why did you decide to run in the 2011 Manitoba election?</strong></p>

<p>The election is an important time to reach the people of Minto with a different idea of what their government could be doing on their behalf. We believe our People’s Agenda policies address the real issues, such as jobs, education, improving society and saving the environment. For example, our goal is to have good-paying jobs for everyone able to work, with a 32 hour work week and no loss in pay. That would go a long way to end poverty.</p>

<p><strong>What experience will you bring to compliment your role as MLA?</strong></p>

<p>Years of working with people in a helping capacity and witnessing the lives of Manitoba families from a very close perspective especially when they are in difficult situations has been very significant in suggesting what families really need.  I have taught school up north and on reserve and in the inner city.  I worked in community development for Central Child and Family Services for over a decade. Seeing people rise to the challenges and face their problems when there are often inadequate resources makes me want to do more to change society rather than support band-aid solutions.  I have also raised my own family of 6 mostly alone and am watching them raise their own as well.  We know from experience life is not always easy no matter how hard you try.  Equality has to mean more than lip service.</p>

<p><strong>Is there anything in particular you would like to change in our province? In your electoral division?</strong></p>

<p>I have an extensive list. For Manitoba, such as working for full Aboriginal rights, because of the continuing colonial conditions. We need a new relationship of equality with all nations in Canada, and greater compensation for the genocide that has taken place such as with residential schools. We would also work to improve immigrant rights by recognizing education credentials, reducing the size of the large pool of low-wage workers in this province. We would reverse the public service wage cuts. Workers should not lose because of inflation. I already mentioned our goal for jobs and ending poverty, but using the added resources from full employment we would raise social assistance above the poverty line and launch a massive home building program.</p>

<p><strong>What is one thing you stand for that is not a part of your political party's platform?</strong></p>

<p>The party platform is extensive and always evolving with new technology and understanding, but the basic principles are really about what works for human beings and the world they live in.  With that basis, most truly good ideas would make their way on to our platform.  I am not dwelling on being against things because I am fully convinced that when the agenda of jobs, education, housing, recreation and arts, transportation, and redistributing wealth is secured the negative problems will be all but gone and much easier to deal with.  A just and rewarding life is fully within our grasp if we want to have it for ourselves and our neighbours.</p>

<p><strong>Do you have any other comments regarding your candidacy?</strong></p>

<p>Our long term goal is socialism and I know more and more people understand we need it to make society much fairer. Our present system is based on greed, violence and exploitation. It cannot last.</p>

<p>In Minto, I believe we should be paying students or their families to stay in school, not hiring new truant officers who would end up criminalizing more youth in the core area. Poverty is a big problem in Minto and it’s connected to health, so we would expand universal health to cover eye, dental and drugs. We will raise the minimum wage to $16.25 an hour. Many of our policies deal with ending racism and sexism, such as with fair and mandatory hiring targets. Our tax policy would help home owners by removing education from property taxes; we need to base taxes more on ability to pay, so we would have a wealth and inheritance tax, hike taxes on higher earners and cut taxes for the working poor.</p>

<p><strong>What is your favourite location in the electoral division you are currently a candidate for?</strong></p>

<p>The beauty of the Minto riding lies in the people themselves.  I love going door to door talking to the different people and hearing what’s going on in their lives or what’s currently on their minds.  Residents are justly proud and I am always thrilled with the gardens and what they can be coaxed to do. I am a big fan of the Arts and Crafts design movement of 100 years ago and we see a lot here.  I really am interested in what other people have done to keep their houses authentic.</p>

<p>Our home parish for many years was St.Edward’s Church on Arlington which is a beautiful spiritual place.  My mother taught in the school and I taught Sunday school.  We had many good times there and I never pass by without the thought of my mom.</p>

<p>But the best place in the area has to be Jacob Penner Park.  That’s the place I fell in love with my partner Darrell when I heard him give a speech during the annual People’s Voice Picnic.  I will always feel close to this place named for the famous communist and the beginning of so many good things in my life.</p>
