Dean Koshelanyk - Tyndall Park
</p>
<p><strong>Why did you decide to run in the 2011 Manitoba election?</strong></p>

<p>The politics of today are not working. Too many times we see our current elected officials simply trying to one up the other or blame each other for failures of the past. We need new, fresh ideas and solutions that come from the grassroots to help ensure our children, grandchildren, great grandchildren and beyond have a great place that they can live, work and play.</p>

<p>I can bring those ideas to the table by being a strong advocate for all residents of our constituency, city and province.</p>

<p><strong>What experience will you bring to compliment your role as MLA?</strong></p>

<p>I have an honours diploma in Computer Programming.</p>

<p>I have worked in the finance, insurance, health care, electronic gaming, forestry, farming, construction, and retail sales fields of work.</p>

<p>I have volunteered on numerous community boards and have in depth knowledge of many of the issues that impact our residents.</p>

<p> <strong>Is there anything in particular you would like to change in our province?</strong></p>

<p>I believe the way our health care is currently being offered is out of date and the model needs to be looked at. It should be easier for patients to get access to family doctors, our reliance on walk in clinics needs to be reduced and the wait time to see specialists needs to be changed and monitored so that we don’t have people’s health getting even worse while they wait.</p>

<p><strong>In your electoral division?</strong></p>

<p>I would love to see a multi-use facility rise in the area that would have access for various indoor sports, community gatherings and the like. There is no facility even remotely close by that is available for our residents to use and having one that would go a long way to getting more people involved in the community.</p>

<p><strong>What is one thing you stand for that is not a part of your political party's platform?</strong></p>

<p>I believe that at all levels of the political process there should be a mechanism for the removal of an election official by the electorate between elections. I would like to see a recall process implemented that will allow this to happen.</p>

<p><strong>Do you have any other comments regarding your candidacy?</strong></p>

<p>Many people ask or say, isn't a vote for you a wasted vote? I say to them, the only wasted vote is when someone does not vote. The Green Party of Manitoba has 32 candidates, that is more then enough to form government. Take the time to actually consider the platforms presented to you, ignore the negative rhetoric generated only to confuse you and you will see that a vote for me is a vote for a stronger Manitoba for you, for your children, for your grand children and beyond.</p>

<p><strong>What is your favourite location in the electoral division you are currently a candidate for?</strong></p>

<p>I love going to the park(s) near Garden Grove school that I take my son to play at all the time and sitting in my front yard watching my son play and conversing with my neighbours as they walk by is fantastic.</p>
