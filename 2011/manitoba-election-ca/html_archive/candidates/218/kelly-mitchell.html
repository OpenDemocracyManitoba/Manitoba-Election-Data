Kelly Mitchell - River East
</p>
<p><strong>Why did you decide to run in the 2011 Manitoba election?</strong></p>

<p>I am proud to be running for the green party of Manitoba, which is not only a Manitoba movement, a Canadian movement,  but an International movement.</p>

<p>I believe that current political activity in our community has become complacent and that our residents deserve better. Our community is in need of change. When you vote green you are sending a message to the other parties that the environment is important to you, worth saving, and that you want to capitalize on the opportunity to move toward an eco-economy that is sustainable and puts money in the pockets of the everyday regular Manitobans not in the pockets of multi-national companies.</p>

<p><strong>What experience will you bring to compliment your role as MLA?</strong></p>

<p> As a parent and former teacher, the education and wellbeing of our children is extremely important to me. If elected, one of my first tasks is getting green policy into the school system and green education into the classrooms province wide. As well, I am currently working on a zero waste - Green lunch program, a recycling program, and a composting program in schools in River East. If the 3 R's principles are preached but not practiced then they will not work, thus the school system and the curriculum need to work together. The only way to reduce the waste on our planet is to have the next generation on board and committed.</p>

<p><strong>Is there anything in particular you would like to change in our province? In your electoral division?</strong>
I stand for a permanent dike, on Bonner Ave, which is a municipal issue but it fringes on provincial flooding management.  Bonner Ave between Rothesay and Henderson floods almost every spring due to high water levels of the Winnipeg Red River. Therefore, a temporary dike must be built year after year to protect the homes and street. The costs to build a dike, tear down, plus repair the damage caused by the massive construction equipment is in the hundreds of thousands if not the millions each time.  By not having to repair the street, curb, boulevard, driveways, and lawns each spring this will this save us tax payers.</p>

<p>By building an eco friendly permanent dike it will not only be an aesthetic improvement but McIvor park pedestrian and bike trails will flow continuously from one side of creek to the other side without Bonner Ave cutting through it.  This will help divert the traffic on Bonner to use the new Chief Peguis extension. It is still unknown if the new extension will live up to the promises conservatives made to the community and to not ghettoize the area around, as the Disreali bridge did to Elmwood and Point Douglas.</p>

<p><strong>What is one thing you stand for that is not a part of your political party's platform?</strong></p>

<p>Immediately, call centres working on behalf of political parties in this election should be disallowed access to, and the use of the voters list. There are no guarantees that the list is not being added to contact lists for other purposes. It should be either volunteers or paid party staff that uses the voters list.  This list is given out by elections Manitoba to the candidate and when Elections Manitoba hands over the list they should ask the candidate to sign that they will not give this list over to the private sector. I feel it Borderline fringes on privacy act in this country.  If not illegal, I believe it is morally and ethically irresponsible and the public should demand  Elections Manitoba to put a stop to this.</p>

<p><strong>Do you have any other comments regarding your candidacy?</strong></p>

<p>An issue of great concern to me that no other candidate appears to be talking about is the dumping of raw sewage into the Red River by West St. Paul Elementary school. This is just 1 km beyond our River East constituency. Dumping raw sewage is a health hazard to this community; which if elected I would put a stop to it.  Schools should be the pillars of our community paving the way by example.  By tabling this project pushing it into the future, it not only cost the environment, but it's a greater cost to the tax payer.</p>

<p><strong>What is your favourite location in the electoral division you are currently a candidate for?</strong></p>

<p>Coming from my experience as a small business owner I make a strong effort to support small local businesses in my community. It’s hard to pick a favourite but Mountain Bean Coffee is a chic coffee shop and great meeting ground for  interesting people in the neighbourhood. As well, I enjoy shopping at the Canadian Nutrition Centre health food store in McIvor Mall. The owner is very knowledgeable about the products, which are not only organic but healthy.  If I have to pick one location McIvor Park / Bunn’s Creek wins hands down for me. Green space is so valuable to our communities that is why the Green Party is so passionate about protecting it.</p>

<p>Thank you for reading my answers and getting to know a little more about your River East Green Party candidate Kelly Mitchell.  Take a stand, a green vote today is a strategic vote, a vote for a better tomorrow.</p>
