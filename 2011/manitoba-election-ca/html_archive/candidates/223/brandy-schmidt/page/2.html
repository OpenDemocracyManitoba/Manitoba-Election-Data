Brandy Schmidt - Fort Whyte 2012 By-Election
</p>
<p><strong>Why did you decide to run in the 2012 Manitoba by-election?</strong></p>

<p>I think families in the Fort Whyte constituency, need a voice in government that will stand-up for them on their issues and bring forward solutions and results. I will do that. I’m a believer that the best way to understand the local issues is to start talking to the people that live there. I’ve learned a lot from many of the other NDP MLA’s and sometimes it’s just the simple conversations at the doorstep that lead to the most effective solutions. I’ve been doing a lot of that – and have met many wonderful people on the doorstep and on the streets in Fort Whyte. It’s a dynamic
community that’s growing.</p>

<p><strong>What experience will you bring to compliment your role as MLA?</strong></p>

<p>I’m a proud Winnipegger and Manitoban. I’m interested in helping communities reach their potential and helping youth stay active. I’ve worked with the West Broadway Youth Outreach and Local Investment Toward Employment (LITE). I have spent the past three years working as the Community Engagement Manager for The Multiple Sclerosis Society of Canada in Manitoba, and this has enabled me to work hands-on with community members.</p>

<p><strong>Is there anything in particular you would like to change in our province? In your electoral division?</strong></p>

<p>Like I said, Fort Whyte is on the right path, growing and thriving. We need to champion that, and keep continuing this. But to keep things on the right path, and keep this a neighborhood that’s safe and fun for our children and diverse for entrepreneurs, we need to make sure we have representation in government that will be looking out for the best interests of the families.</p>

<p><strong>What values or ideals will you adhere to if elected?</strong></p>

<p>I think the biggest values anyone elected to office can bring to the job is honesty and commitment. You have to keep an open dialogue with constituents and be committed to helping them address their concerns. That’s why my first move would be to open a constituency office so people have a welcoming environment to raise their issues. And, you have to be honest. I’m genuine when I say I care about the community and the priorities for families and the vision they have for the neighborhood. It’s something we all share.</p>

<p><strong>What do you enjoy most about the Fort Whyte electoral division?</strong></p>

<p>It has to be the diversity. There are so many wonderful people that live in this community.</p>

<p><strong>Do you have any other comments regarding your candidacy?</strong></p>

<p>Growing up in Winnipeg's West End neighbourhood, studying International Development, and spending time living overseas is what initially spurred my interest in working at a community level. I've spent the last three years at the MS Society of Canada managing volunteers, working in communications and as a fundraiser with a focus in community engagement and I'm prepared to be a strong voice for the people of Fort Whyte.</p>
