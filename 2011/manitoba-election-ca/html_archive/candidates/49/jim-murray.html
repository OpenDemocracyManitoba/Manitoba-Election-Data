<div class='questionnaire'>
<p class='visible_block_when_mobile'>
Jim Murray - Brandon West
</p>
<p><strong>Why did you decide to run in the 2011 Manitoba election?</strong></p>

<p>I have strong community ties and a long track record of community involvement.  My service as a trustee has instilled in me a deep and satisfying commitment to public service and representing people to the best of my ability.  Serving my community is something I consider an honour.</p>

<p><strong>What experience will you bring to compliment your role as MLA?</strong></p>

<p>My work as a trustee, union steward, cub leader and other community service has prepared me to speak on behalf of other people.  On many occasions, I have fought hard for the people of Brandon. I approach the role of elected representative from the common sense perspective of the average working person.</p>

<p><strong>Is there anything in particular you would like to change in our province? In your electoral division?</strong></p>

<p>Brandon has done very well in the past decade.  We have better education opportunities at all levels, better health care and improvements that have made life better for our families and community.  We need to ensure that our city and province continue to move forward.</p>
