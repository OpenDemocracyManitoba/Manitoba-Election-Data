Stan Struthers - Dauphin
</p>
<p><strong>Why did you decide to run in the 2011 Manitoba election?</strong></p>

<p>I'm excited to continue building my community and province. I have always been community minded, and to see so much positive growth in recent years is exciting. Lets keep it growing!</p>

<p><strong>What experience will you bring to compliment your role as MLA?</strong></p>

<p>I've been accessible and involved in my community for over two decades. I now add to that the contacts and experience that comes with being a cabinet minister for eight years. Re-electing me ensures we continue to grow and prosper together.</p>

<p><strong>Is there anything in particular you would like to change in our province? In your electoral division?</strong></p>

<p>I'm proud we have brought more health-care services closer to home. A changing demographic will put new pressures on housing needs in the years ahead.  And as always, our local economy is based on a vibrant agricultural sector that requires continued programs to support its growth.</p>
