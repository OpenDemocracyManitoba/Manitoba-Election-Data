<p class='visible_block_when_mobile'>
Kerri Irvin-Ross - Fort Richmond
</p>
<p><strong>Why did you decide to run in the 2011 Manitoba election?</strong></p>

<p>The decision to run was easy. I love my job! I was first elected in 2003 and it has been a privilege to represent local residents and serve the community.  It is the most rewarding and gratifying job anyone can ever have.</p>

<p><strong>What experience will you bring to compliment your role as MLA?</strong></p>

<p>Before becoming MLA I was a social worker for the Child Guidance Centre, working with youth and families. My experience in helping others - through the buiding of strong and stable communities - it makes for healthy families. I am a strong believer that it takes a village to raise a child.</p>

<p><strong>Is there anything in particular you would like to change in our province? In your electoral division?</strong></p>

<p>  I believe that working to build community involvement is work that is never done. Community development is close to my heart and I really believe that many challenges that families must endure as part of life, can be made easier through local involvement in their communities.  When individuals come together to work together we can accomplish great things that benefit everyone.</p>

<p><strong>What is one thing you stand for that is not a part of your political party's platform?</strong></p>

<p>My values are the same as my party, Today’s NDP. We share the same vision, we share the same values and the same philosophy -  that no one should be left behind and equality is for everyone.</p>

<p><strong>Do you have any other comments regarding your candidacy?</strong></p>

<p> I bring experience as a cabinet minister, as a social worker, mother and MLA to the job. I’ve worked hard all my life and will continue to work diligently for my constituents, to listen to their concerns and work with the community to build a safer, more prosperous society for all.</p>

<p><strong>What is your favourite location in the electoral division you are currently a candidate for?</strong></p>

<p>   Firstly I love  all areas of my constituency, but  since I have to choose one location, I would say, Kings Park , for peaceful walks with my dogs , while watching families enjoy  the beautiful scenery and a  fun day out together.</p>
