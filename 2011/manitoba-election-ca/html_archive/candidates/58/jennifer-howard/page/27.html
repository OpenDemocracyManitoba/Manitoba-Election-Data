<p class='visible_block_when_mobile'>
Jennifer Howard - Fort Rouge
</p>
<p><strong>Why did you decide to run in the 2011 Manitoba election?</strong></p>

<p>I am running because I believe that working with Manitobans, our government is building a Manitoba that has more opportunities for everyone. I also love working with people who want to make a difference in their community!</p>

<p><strong>What experience will you bring to compliment your role as MLA?</strong></p>

<p>I have worked hard since 2007 with residents in Fort Rouge to build new child care   spaces, invest in local schools, create programs to help seniors live independently and to make our neighbourhoods safer. The people I have met in Fort Rouge have great ideas to make their communities better places to live, and I want to keep working with them to achieve these goals.</p>

<p><strong>Is there anything in particular you would like to change in our province? In your electoral division?</strong></p>

<p>Health care, infrastructure, safety and privatization of Manitoba Hydro.</p>
