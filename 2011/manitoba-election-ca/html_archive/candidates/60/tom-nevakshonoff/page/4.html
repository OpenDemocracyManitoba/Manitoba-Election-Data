<p class='visible_block_when_mobile'>
Tom Nevakshonoff - Interlake
</p>
<p><strong>Why did you decide to run in the 2011 Manitoba election?</strong></p>

<p>My father inspired me. He grew up during the depression in Saskatchewan where there were no public services available. He believed in helping people who were in need. Political debate was a constant in my home growing up.</p>

<p><strong>What experience will you bring to compliment your role as MLA?</strong></p>

<p>As a life-long resident I know the issues that are important to people of the Interlake. I have had the honour of being MLA for the Interlake since 1999.  I have accumulated the experience and knowledge necessary to best represent our area.</p>

<p><strong>Is there anything in particular you would like to change in our province? In your electoral division?</strong></p>

<p>The flood and the damage it caused are the biggest issues facing the Interlake. I am proud our government has stepped up and provided the necessary help. I want to ensure the people affected by flooding are compensated and plans continue to build the necessary infrastructure to avert future flood damage.</p>
