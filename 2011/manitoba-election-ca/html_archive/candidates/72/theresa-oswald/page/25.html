<p class='visible_block_when_mobile'>
Theresa Oswald - Seine River
</p>
<p><strong>Why did you decide to run in the 2011 Manitoba election?</strong></p>

<p>I was originally inspired to run by my students in a leadership course I was teaching, but now I'm running to help continue the important work that we're doing on behalf of families in Manitoba.</p>

<p><strong>What experience will you bring to compliment your role as MLA?</strong></p>

<p>I know this community well as I have lived here nearly all my life, and I have connected with many families throughout my teaching career. Building and maintaining strong relationships is very important to me, and critical for a good MLA.</p>

<p><strong>Is there anything in particular you would like to change in our province? In your electoral division?</strong></p>

<p>Citizens in Seine River care deeply about access to health care when they need it, access to quality affordable day care and long-term care and developing strong, vibrant schools. They want strong, strategic investment in these key areas.</p>
