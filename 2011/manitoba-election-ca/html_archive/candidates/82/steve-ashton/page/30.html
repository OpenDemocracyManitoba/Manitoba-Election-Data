Steve Ashton - Thompson
</p>
<p><strong>Why did you decide to run in the 2011 Manitoba election?</strong></p>

<p>Manitoba has made significant progress since the NDP formed government in 1999. We will keep Manitoba moving forward.  An NDP government will continue to grow our economy, build our infrastructure, and invest in health care, education, and social services.</p>

<p><strong>What experience will you bring to compliment your role as MLA?</strong></p>

<p>The Thompson constituency needs an MLA who is committed to building a better Northern Manitoba for everyone. By continuing to work together we keep moving forward.</p>

<p><strong>Is there anything in particular you would like to change in our province? In your electoral division?</strong></p>

<p>Continued investments in northern roads, complete the new UCN campus &amp; invest in northern health care, education &amp; recreation.</p>
