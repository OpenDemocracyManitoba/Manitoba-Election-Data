Daryl Reid - Transcona
</p>
<p><strong>Why did you decide to run in the 2011 Manitoba election?</strong></p>

<p>I’m running to continue to build services and supports for the families in Transcona.</p>

<p><strong>What experience will you bring to compliment your role as MLA?</strong></p>

<p>I am experienced, dedicated, and committed to the priorities of Transcona residents.  An NDP government will continue to invest in strengthening communities like ours.</p>

<p><strong>Is there anything in particular you would like to change in our province? In your electoral division?</strong></p>

<p>Seniors housing, healthy living and recreation &amp; daycare spaces.</p>
