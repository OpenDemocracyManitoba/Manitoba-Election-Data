Shaun Cameron - Brandon East
</p>
<p><strong>Why did you decide to run in the 2011 Manitoba election?</strong></p>

<p>I became involved to see Brandon move forward. We need to have a vision for our future and the Manitoba Liberal Party offers that vision, I hope to offer that vision. We need to make sure we are caring for the needs of all residents in our community to allow for growth of our community.</p>

<p><strong>What experience will you bring to compliment your role as MLA?</strong></p>

<p>I have been involved in civic leadership through Renaissance Brandon as the Vice Chairman and Communications committee chair for the board of directors. I love to be involved in our community and want to see that we are growing an adapting for a changing world.</p>

<p><strong>Is there anything in particular you would like to change in our province? In your electoral division?</strong></p>

<p>See greater needs addressed for affordable housing in our community. We need to be prepared for our growing housing need in Brandon and programs that support sustainable long-term housing I would whole heatedly support.</p>

<p><strong>What is one thing you stand for that is not a part of your political party's platform?</strong></p>

<p>Making sure that Brandon has the ability to be a strong stand alone entity in the Province and have the facilities and infrastructure to allow for this.</p>

<p><strong>Do you have any other comments regarding your candidacy?</strong></p>

<p>I want to make sure that youth have a voice in our community. Youth are the leaders of today and should become involved to enact change in our community.</p>
