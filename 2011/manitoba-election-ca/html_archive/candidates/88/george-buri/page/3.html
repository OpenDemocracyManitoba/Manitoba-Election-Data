<p class='visible_block_when_mobile'>
George Buri - Brandon West
</p>
<p><strong>Why did you decide to run in the 2011 Manitoba election?</strong></p>

<p>The Liberal platform appealed to me because it is a platform designed for people, to improve their lives.  Liberals care and Liberals put people first.  The Party has a leader who is honest and caring.</p>

<p><strong>What experience will you bring to compliment (sp, complement) your role as MLA?</strong></p>

<p>I have over 30 years of teaching – high school, adults, Faculty of Education, and theatre.  I was a school trustee and I have been the Artistic Director of 7 Ages Productions for 14 years.  I am highly organized and I get things done.</p>

<p><strong>Is there anything in particular you would like to change in our province? In your electoral division?</strong></p>

<p>When I see Manitobans living in third world conditions, I am saddened.  Infrastructure and opportunities must be provided for those who need the most help.</p>

<p><strong>What is one thing you stand for that is not a part of your political party's platform?</strong></p>

<p>We have to find a way for everyone, not just those who have money, to use and experience some of the facilities that were built partly or wholly with public money.  That includes ballet, theatre, concerts, and sporting events.  The public subsidizes but many can never experience any of these events directly.</p>

<p><strong>Do you have any other comments regarding your candidacy?</strong></p>

<p>Democracy can only be healthy if people take an active role as voters and candidates, or engage in meaningful discussion.  By running in this election, I am giving something back to the community and contributing to the democratic process.  I believe that I am not so much a politician as an ordinary person who wants to help make this society stronger.</p>

<p><strong>What is your favourite location in the electoral division you are currently a candidate for?</strong></p>

<p>The Western Manitoba Centennial Auditorium – I have spent a good portion of my life there as a director, actor, and producer.</p>
