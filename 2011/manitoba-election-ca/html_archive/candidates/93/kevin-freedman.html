Kevin Freedman - Fort Garry-Riverview
</p>
<p><strong>Why did you decide to run in the 2011 Manitoba election?</strong></p>

<p>There are many reasons why I decided to run in this election. As a progressive-minded person who is quite disappointed with how the province has been run for the past several years, I think it is important to have an option other than a fiscally irresponsible government that runs more on rhetoric than on action or one that feels the need to make drastic cuts to essential services on ideological grounds. I think it is very important to bring environmental issues to the forefront of politics and to promote policies that will improve our education and health care systems and solve our violent crime problems effectively. With my background and experience I think that I would be the best person to accomplish this.</p>

<p><strong>What experience will you bring to compliment your role as MLA?</strong></p>

<p>For most of my adult life I have worked with many of Winnipeg’s least fortunate people, homeless suffering from mental illness, youth from broken homes. I see many of the biggest issues facing our province on a daily basis.</p>

<p>At the moment I sit on five volunteer Boards, some of which are very agreeable and some of which are quite contentious and I have helped all but one in developing an organizational strategy and corporate vision. I am currently Past-President of the Manitoba Water Polo Association and Board Secretary with the Manitoba Eco-Network.</p>

<p>Over the past several years I have created a number of successful projects ranging from starting an ad-hoc aid organization following a deadly earthquake I survived, to the 25 litre Water Conservation Challenge, an annual event that has saved more than a million litres of water.</p>

<p><strong>Is there anything in particular you would like to change in our province? In your electoral division?</strong></p>

<p>There are a number of things I would like to seen changed, not so much in our province but in how our province is governed. I do not like to see the government absorbing Manitoba Hydro’s profits and calling it general revenue, this money should be reinvested in more renewable energy sources or offered in rebates to those you practice energy conservation. I think that more focus in our government departments must be placed on efficiency and preventative measures</p>

<p><strong>What is one thing you stand for that is not a part of your political party's platform?</strong></p>

<p>I feel very strongly that we need to relook at our drug laws in Manitoba and in Canada. It genuinely angers me to think that many of my friends are “criminals”  merely due to the recreational drug they choose. I know architects, lawyers, entrepreneurs, doctors, and politicians who enjoy using marijuana and while I do not condone its use, prohibitive drugs laws, especially in the case of marijuana, do much more harm than good. There is a good possibility that revisiting these laws on a provincial and federal level could help to save an enormous about of money while debilitating organized crime</p>

<p><strong>Do you have any other comments regarding your candidacy?</strong></p>

<p>My campaign has been run in an unconventional manner as I am an unconventional candidate. We are placing little effort into fundraising and instead focusing all of our effort on engaging the electorate through a variety of methods not used by other candidates such as online videos, twitter and facebook, bicycle convoys, public and school presentations and striving to spend at least one day canvassing with other candidates.</p>

<p><strong>What is your favourite location in the electoral division you are currently a candidate for?</strong></p>

<p>I have a number of favorite spots in my electoral division. I enjoy trying some of the 150 kinds of beer I can get at Luxalune Gastropub, the Park Theatre is always a fun place to be, and Delicious restaurant on Pembina Highway has some of Winnipeg’s best vegetarian fare. But my favourite spots have to be along the riverfront on Churchill Drive and South Drive. At one spot in particular, halfway from the Riverview Health Centre to the Rowing Club is a secluded spot along the riverwalk where there is a large stone slab which has a lovely quote carved on it and a couple of seats to sit. It is only a few kilometres from downtown but it feels like the country, it is a pretty magical little spot.</p>
