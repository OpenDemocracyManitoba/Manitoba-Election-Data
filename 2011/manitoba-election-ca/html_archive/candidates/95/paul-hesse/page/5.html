Paul Hesse - Fort Rouge
</p>
<p><strong>Why did you decide to run in the 2011 Manitoba election?</strong></p>

<p>As a long-time resident, I know the values and needs of the area.  I can bring better representation and advocacy on safety, housing, transit and the other issues affecting our neighbourhoods.  People are better served by an MLA who lives in the constituency and who will fight for our needs.</p>

<p><strong>What experience will you bring to compliment your role as MLA?</strong></p>

<p>I have experience in government, having worked for a federal cabinet minister before starting my career.   I have studied the language of law and understand our provincial legal system, including its strengths and failings.  As a citizen, I have been very active in the community.  For example, I co-founded the Winnipeg Rapid Transit Coalition which advocates for improvements to transit and building rapid transit.</p>

<p><strong>Is there anything in particular you would like to change in our province? In your electoral division?</strong></p>

<p>There are many things that need change or improvement.  Our health care system needs to work better for patients.  We need to invest more in early childhood learning and screening of treatable conditions.  We are not yet properly dealing with the diabetes epidemic.  The waiting list for addiction treatment spots is far too long.  The list goes on and on.</p>

<p>In Fort Rouge, we need to undo some of the damage to community safety.  When the NDP took power 12 years ago, there was a community police station in the area.  That has been closed.  There was a regular foot patrol in Osborne Village.  That ended.  Community officers have been redeployed to other areas.  I will work to bring back regular foot patrols to the area, likely through an expansion of the provincially-funded police cadet program.</p>

<p>The rental situation has also been badly deteriorating.  The vacancy rate is at 0.7% and keeps dropping. Many rental buildings have been converted to condominiums, but new apartments aren't been built to replace them. Many people have had their rents go up by 10% or more per year. I will fight for renters. This includes pushing for more apartments to be built by the rapid transit stations being built. I will also fight for changes to the Residential Tenancies Act.</p>

<p><strong>What is one thing you stand for that is not a part of your political party's platform?</strong></p>

<p>There are always local needs that are unique. As MLA, I will be working to fund and designate an off-leash dog park in the constituency.</p>

<p><strong>Do you have any other comments regarding your candidacy?</strong></p>

<p>Around the world, people have been fighting for the right to participate in democracy. The revolutions in north Africa and the Middle East show that people are fighting for what we often take for granted. We must embrace democracy.</p>

<p>Many people are interested when I come to their door. They appreciate a candidate who takes the time to meet with them and listen to them. I am inspired when people here fully engage in democracy.</p>

<p><strong>What is your favourite location in the electoral division you are currently a candidate for?</strong></p>

<p>I live very close to some great restaurants. With my sweet tooth, I have a soft spot for Baked Expectations.</p>
