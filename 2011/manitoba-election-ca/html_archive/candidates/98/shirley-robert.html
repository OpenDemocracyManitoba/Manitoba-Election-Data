Shirley Robert - Radisson
</p>
<p><strong>Why did you decide to run in the 2011 Manitoba election?</strong></p>

<p>My three kids inspire me to create a wonderful home province full of opportunity for their futures. I believe that our education system needs to be adjusted so that all children can shine at their best and brightest with no limitations but their own.  I am also a chronic illness patient that had to deal with a roller coaster ride through the health care system and I would like to be hands on in bringing change to the system for all patients that need access to doctors, treatments, home care and medications.</p>

<p><strong>What experience will you bring to compliment your role as MLA?</strong></p>

<p>My background is in Project Management. I’ve been with The Kellan Group since May 2000 and worked from an administrative position to my current position of Chief Learning Officer. I’m not afraid of hard work and know the keys to making any project a success from painting a bathroom to a full computer system upgrade of over 11,000 terminals. My experiences in the health care system from 2006 – 2008 gave me a passion to act for change. I’m also an advocate for The Arthritis Society and from that I’ve learned that political stripes don’t matter when it comes to a common goal.</p>

<p><strong>Is there anything in particular you would like to change in our province?</strong></p>

<p>I’d love to see more access to farmer’s markets in the province. With my disease I have learned the value in health living and I would like to make it easier for everyone in Manitoba to have access to the basics of good nutrition which would help us in lower health care costs overall. I’d also like to look at helping the education support the needs of all the students in the schools of Manitoba.</p>

<p><strong>In your electoral division?</strong></p>

<p>I’d love to help create more community support funding so that all community clubs are able to have programs, upgrades, staff and other resources they need to run their programs and to keep sport accessible to all youth in the community. I firmly believe that community clubs in the city matter and would commit to helping them continue and improve their valuable services.</p>

<p><strong>What is one thing you stand for that is not a part of your political party's platform?</strong></p>

<p>I’d like to see more medical research and clinical trial options become available for chronic illness patients. Patients of sound mind should be allowed to be active partners in their treatments and be given all the options so they can be pro-active in their own care.</p>

<p><strong>Do you have any other comments regarding your candidacy?</strong></p>

<p>I consider this experience to be one of several thousand job interviews put into a 4 week time span. I am hoping that folks will take a minute to listen to what I have to say and when they go to vote they will put their faith in me by hiring me to represent them. I can think of no job in the world as important as being in public office. This has been a life changing learning experience and also very life affirming as well. I’ve been honoured to be the Liberal option for Radisson voters and hope that I can be there for them in years to come.</p>

<p><strong>What is your favourite location in the electoral division you are currently a candidate for?</strong></p>

<p>My home in Windsor Park. It is where my heart is along with my family. My favourite moments often come from enjoying a meal with my family around our dinner table at night.</p>
