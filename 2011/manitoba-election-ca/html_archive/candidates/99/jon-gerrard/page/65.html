Jon Gerrard - River Heights
</p>
<p><strong>Why did you decide to run in the 2011 Manitoba election?</strong></p>

<p>I am seeking re-election because in my 13 years in legislature, the need for improvement in our province has never been more vital. Manitoba deserves a strong, honest, determined leader in order to protect our future, the future of our children and that of our children’s children. I am committed to continue using my experience and work ethic as long as it will benefit the province. As a father and a pediatrician who has taught and researched at the University of Manitoba as well as looked after children with cancer, I have seen the problems in health care first-hand and I see a better way forward.  With a degree in economics and experience in the federal cabinet, I see how we can better manage the finances of our province to help facilitate job growth, and improve our industries in Manitoba.  With long-term experience in dealing with environmental issues, I see a better approach to environmental stewardship in our province. With elected experience at both the federal (4 years) and provincial (13 years) levels of government, I believe I have the background to make a difference for people in Manitoba.</p>

<p><strong>What experience will you bring to compliment your role as MLA?</strong></p>

<p>Along with my 13 years of experience as a MLA for River Heights, I was a Member of Parliament for Portage-Interlake from 1993-1997. During this period I served in the federal cabinet as Minister of Science, Research, and Development as well as Minister of Western Economic Development. I played a major role in advancing the Information Highway and in policy initiatives like the Community Access program to help connect Canadians to the Internet. As Minister of Western Economic Development I strongly supported small businesses and entrepreneurs in Western Canada. I brought forward many initiatives to aid the Community Futures Development Program, including initiatives for Youth Entrepreneurs, for Entrepreneurs with Disabilities, and for mentoring and training business development officers. Additionally, I introduced various approaches to foster innovative businesses in the information technology, environmental technology, and biotechnology.</p>

<p><strong>Is there anything in particular you would like to change in our province? In your electoral division?</strong></p>

<p>I believe there is so much more that must be done in Manitoba to prepare our province for the future. This is why I am seeking re-election. Crime must to be addressed in our community so people feel safe. More programs for youth and seniors are required. Quality education (from early childhood education to post-secondary) is a priority. I believe we must focus on innovative solutions to health care in our province. Wait times for treatment continue to be a problem that I will work to address. Seniors need care so they can live a healthy and affordable lifestyle. They deserve to have more of a voice and be better taken care of whether they live in a personal care home or in their own home. Municipal issues related to infrastructure need to be addressed, as well as our roads demanding major improvements. A water management strategy needs to be put into place. I welcome the opportunity to work with individuals and groups to achieve benefits for all Manitobans.</p>

<p><strong>What is one thing you stand for that is not a part of your political party's platform?</strong></p>

<p>The environmental issues are part of my party’s platform but possibly what the voters don’t know about me is that I deeply care about the environment and I continue to research and write about bald eagles and their habitat.</p>

<p><strong>Do you have any other comments regarding your candidacy?</strong></p>

<p>I have represented River Heights as the MLA in the legislature for 12 years.  During this time our Liberal presence in the Legislature, though small, has accomplished numerous victories in the form of improvements for Manitobans.   Legislation initiated by myself and Kevin Lamoureux which has passed includes The Apology Act, The Good Samaritan Act, Legislation to provide for 24 hour access to medical records in hospitals and personal care homes, Legislation to improve reporting of medical errors, legislation to facilitate organ donation and legislation to remove phosphorous from automatic dishwasher detergents. In addition, we have promoted many other measures to address poverty, Jordan’s Principle, to improve understanding, diagnosis, prevention, and help for those with FASD, and to improve health and wellness.</p>

<p><strong>What is your favourite location in the electoral division you are currently a candidate for?</strong></p>

<p>My wife and I are River Heights residents and have lived here for many years. I love every part of my community, but one of my favourite things is the arching elm trees on our River Heights streets. I feel they embody the spirit of this wonderful neighbourhood.</p>
