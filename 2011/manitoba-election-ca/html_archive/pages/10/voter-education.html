<h2>Election Basics</h2>

<p><a name="why_election"></a>
<strong>Why is Manitoba having an election?</strong></p>

<p>The Elections Act states that October 4th, 2011 is to be the date of a general election in Manitoba. This is the first fixed date for an election in Manitoba. Future general elections will be held on the first Tuesday of October every four years.</p>

<p class="small">
Source: <a href="http://web2.gov.mb.ca/laws/statutes/ccsm/e030e.php">The Elections Act - Manitoba (section 49.1(2))</a>
</p>




<br/>


<p><a name="what_election"></a>
<strong>What is a general election?</strong></p>

<p>A general election in Manitoba is an election in which every electoral division in the province holds an election. In each electoral division, the candidate with the highest number of votes becomes an MLA. A general election is different from a by-election, which is an election for a smaller number of electoral divisions. A by-election could happen after an MLA resigns or dies while in office.</p>

<p class="small">
Source: <a href="http://web2.gov.mb.ca/laws/statutes/ccsm/e030e.php">The Elections Act - Manitoba (section 1: Definitions)</a>
</p>




<br/>


<p><a name="when_election"></a>
<strong>When does a provincial election happen?</strong></p>

<p>An election takes place in Manitoba on the first Tuesday in October every four years. The next three scheduled provincial elections after October 4th will take place:</p>

<ul>
<li>Tuesday, October 6th, 2015</li>
<li>Tuesday, October 1st, 2019</li>
<li>Tuesday, October 3rd, 2023</li>
</ul>


<p>An election may also be called under special circumstances. If the majority of the MLAs do not support the government budget, certain proposed laws, or the plans announced during what is called ‘The Speech from the Throne’, then the government ‘loses the confidence of the House’. At this point the Lieutenant Governor (the representative of the Queen) can either choose to call an election or to have somebody else become Premier and form a government that has the confidence of the House.</p>

<p><a name="type_election"></a>
<strong>What is the difference between a provincial election, a federal election, and a municipal election?</strong></p>

<p><strong>Provincial Election:</strong> A general election is held for each geographic area of Manitoba in order to elect Members of the Legislative Assembly (MLAs). These members create and vote on laws that fall under provincial jurisdiction in the Manitoba Legislature in Winnipeg.</p>

<p><strong>Federal Election:</strong> A general election is held for each geographic area of Canada, including within Manitoba, in order to elect Members of Parliament (MPs). These members create and vote on laws that fall under federal jurisdiction in parliament in Ottawa.</p>

<p>Canada’s constitution is the document that outlines what areas of law the provinces and federal government have the power to create. For instance, an MLA may create laws relating to how education is delivered, but an MP may not. Similarly an MP may create laws relating to what is in the Criminal Code, but an MLA may not.</p>

<p>One area that falls under provincial jurisdiction is that of municipalities, such as towns, cities, and rural municipalities. The provinces determine the rules under which a municipality is to be governed through creating laws such as ‘The Municipal Act’ and ‘The Municipal Councils and School Boards Election Act’.</p>

<p><strong>Municipal Election:</strong> A general election is held for each geographic area within an urban municipality (city or town) or rural municipality, in order to elect members of Council (Councillors) and mayors (urban) or reeves (rural). These members create and vote on bylaws that fall under the jurisdiction granted to them under the province. Specific spheres of jurisdiction are available under the Municipal Act and the City of Winnipeg Charter.</p>

<p><a name="type_candidate"></a>
<strong>What is the difference between a prospective candidate, an official candidate, and an MLA?</strong></p>

<p>A prospective candidate is somebody who nominates themselves as an independent candidate, or is nominated as a candidate by a political party. Each candidate is nominated for one electoral division.</p>

<p>An official candidate is a prospective candidate who submits their nomination papers, which include 100 signatures from qualified voters within the electoral division. The papers must be submitted after the beginning of the election and before the deadline at 1PM on September 13th, 2011. Official candidates are those you will have the choice of selecting when you vote.</p>

<p>An MLA, or Member of the Legislative Assembly, is the official candidate who receives the highest number of votes, which are counted on Election Day. Only one MLA may be elected in any electoral division.</p>

<p><a name="about_candidate"></a>
<strong>How do I find out what the candidates stand for?</strong></p>

<p>Determining who is a good candidate is a judgment call that you get to make as a voter. You can make this decision in whatever way you choose. Our website provides you with several ways to contact your candidates so that you may ask him or her your questions. You may also view all recent news articles relevant to each candidate on the candidate page by clicking on a candidate's name.</p>

<p>On September 13th, the day after which no more candidates can be nominated, we will provide all candidates with the following questions and post their responses on our website after a short period:</p>

<ul>
<li>Why did you decide to run in the 2011 Manitoba election?</li>
<li>What experience will you bring to compliment your role as MLA?</li>
<li>Is there anything in particular you would like to change in our province? In your constituency?</li>
<li>What is one thing you stand for that is not a part of your political party's platform?</li>
<li>Do you have any other comments regarding your candidacy?</li>
</ul>


<p>You may also review the information candidates provide about themselves on their website, facebook page, or through their twitter and youtube accounts. Most candidates have a short bio that allows you to learn a little bit about their background.</p>

<br/>


<p><a name="what_constit"></a>
<strong>What is a constituency?</strong></p>

<p>A constituency is another name for an electoral division, which is a geographic area in which the people are represented by an elected MLA. There are 57 constituencies in Manitoba, covering all areas of the province. The candidate who wins your electoral division during an election will hold one of the 57 ‘seats’ in the Manitoba Legislature.</p>

<p>You can view your candidates by selecting your constituency on our home page. If you do not know what constituency you reside in, you can find out from Elections Manitoba by entering your address <a href="http://electionsmanitoba.ca/election/voters/where.asp">here</a>.</p>

<br/>


<p><a name="boundary_constit"></a>
<strong>How are constituency boundaries created?</strong></p>

<p>The electoral division boundaries are drawn and named by the Electoral Boundaries Commission, which was created in 1955 under Manitoba’s Electoral Divisions Act. This is an independent provincial commission responsible for updating the boundaries every ten years to respond to changes in the population across the province. The commission is supported by Elections Manitoba, which provides research and administrative support. The proposed boundaries were changed in 2008 based on 2006 Census data, and will come into effect when this election is called. The full detailed report is available <a href="http://www.boundariescommission.mb.ca/report/EDBC_Final_Report.pdf">here</a>. More information about the commission is available at the Manitoba Boundaries Commission website.</p>

<br/>


<p><a name="who_election"></a>
<strong>Who administers the election?</strong></p>

<p>The provincial elections are run under the Elections Act, which mandates that a Chief Electoral Officer (CEO) be appointed to run the provincial elections. This person oversees the office called ‘Elections Manitoba’. The CEO is appointed by the Lieutenant Governor in Council, with recommendations from the Standing Committee on Legislative Affairs, which has several MLAs from multiple political parties. The CEO must administer the elections “impartially and in compliance with this Act” (Section 27 of the Elections Act). He or she appoints a commissioner, who ensures the act is followed and enforced. More information, including the Mission and Goals of Elections Manitoba, are available on the Elections Manitoba website.</p>

<p><a name="why_electionadmin"></a>
<strong>Why is the electoral system set up the way it is?</strong></p>

<p>The Constitution mandates that Canada have federal and provincial elections in which every Canadian citizen can vote, and where no government can stay in power for more than five years without having an election unless there is a “war, invasion, or insurrection” (Constitution Act 1982 Section 4). It also grants the provinces the power to create additional laws to oversee the elections, which is how The Elections Act was created in Manitoba. All provincial Acts are created through several stages and much discussion with opportunity for input from all MLAs. Acts are passed only with the support from the majority of MLAs.</p>

<h2>Political Party Basics</h2>

<p><a name="party_do"></a>
<strong>What do political parties do?</strong></p>

<p>A political party is a group of voters who may have similar views about how our society should be organized and what governments should do. It can endorse and support candidates to bring the voice and ideas of its members into government. Political parties ensure that candidates have similar views as those of the party, and once elected they maintain some level of party discipline – ensuring members vote as a group.</p>

<p>Every political party in Manitoba has one leader. The leader of the political party that wins the most seats (electoral divisions) generally becomes the premier. Each political party registers with Elections Manitoba, has a headquarters, has a chief financial officer, and must follow regulations set out for leadership contests, for nominating candidates, fundraising, spending, and for financial reporting among other things. All political parties in Manitoba have members, who are able to participate in the party’s direction, leadership contest, and various other gatherings.</p>

<p><a name="party_vote"></a>
<strong>Do I have to vote for a political party?</strong></p>

<p>Your vote is for a candidate who may be a member of a political party, or who may be independent. Your option for who to vote for depends on what candidates have registered in your electoral division. Not all electoral divisions have independent candidates, and not all political parties have candidates in every electoral division.</p>

<p><a name="party_diff"></a>
<strong>How is a party leader different from other candidates?</strong></p>

<p>Like other candidates, a political party leader will need to win the majority of the votes in his or her electoral division in order to become an MLA. This candidate usually becomes the premier if the party's candidates wins more seats (electoral divisions) than any other party. Party leaders also differ in that they will be talking about what their party will do if elected in government. Other candidates, while they may promote the party leader’s message, may have greater focus on what they will do in their local electoral division. Because the leader may potentially become the next premier, the media tend to give party leaders much greater publicity than that of other candidates.</p>

<p><a name="party_win"></a>
<strong>What happens to a political party that wins?</strong></p>

<p>A political party that receives more than 50% of the seats (electoral divisions) is asked by the Lieutenant Governor to have its leader become the Premier and form government. If all parties win fewer than 50% of the seats, the party leader that is most likely to keep the confidence of the MLAs is asked to be Premier. This is usually, but not always, the political party that has more seats than any other.</p>

<p>The Premier selects a group of MLAs to become Cabinet Ministers who oversee the daily activities of the ministries and propose new laws. The Premier and the Cabinet Ministers are called Cabinet (also called Executive Council), which is the group that runs the government.</p>

<br/>


<p><a name="party_lose"></a>
<strong>What happens to the political parties that lose?</strong></p>

<p>The political party whose candidates win the second highest number of seats (electoral divisions) is the Official Opposition. Its role is to question the government’s actions and policies and to offer alternatives. Parties that receive fewer seats become Opposition Parties. Opposition members may work together in questioning the government, voting on Bills (proposed laws), and presenting alternatives among other things.</p>

<p><a name="Govt_diff"></a>
<strong>What is the difference between a Majority and a Minority Government?</strong></p>

<p><strong>Majority Government</strong> - If a political party has more than half of the total number of MLAs, that party may pass any Bill into a law, so long as all of its MLAs vote together and are in attendance during votes. All Government Bills, which are those proposed by Cabinet Ministers and the Premier may also be passed into law.</p>

<p><strong>Minority Government</strong> – If a political party has half or fewer than half of the total number of MLAs, that party may not pass any Bill into law that opposition MLAs do not support. If there are more than two political parties, a minority government is possible.</p>

<p>If the majority of the MLAs do not support the government budget, certain proposed laws, or the plans announced during what is called ‘The Speech from the Throne’, then the government ‘loses the confidence of the house’. At this point the government is dissolved and is either replaced by a government that has the ‘confidence of the house’ or an election is called. The choice is for the Lieutenant Governor (representative of the Queen) to make. During a minority government, the government must work to ensure a high enough number of opposition MLAs support these Bills if it wishes to avoid having government 'dissolve'.</p>

<strong>How does somebody become the leader of a political party?</strong></p>

<p>A leader of a political party is selected through a Leadership Contest within that party. This process may differ between political parties, allowing party members to have a direct or indirect influence. Leadership contestants may be voted on within the party to become leader. Every political party has leadership conventions to elect its party leaders. Members can have input in the party’s leader.</p>

<h2>MLA Basics</h2>

<p><a name="MLA_is"></a>
<strong>What is an MLA?</strong></p>

<p>An MLA is a Member of the Legislative Assembly. The Legislative Assembly is the group of 57 people elected to create and vote on laws that govern Manitoba. Each MLA represents the residents of a geographic area within Manitoba, called an electoral division or a constituency. All the land within Manitoba is within the boundaries of a provincial electoral division.</p>

<p class="small">

</p>




<br/>


<p><a name="MLA_who"></a>
<strong>Who is my current MLA?</strong></p>

<p>Your current MLA is the candidate who won the 2007 election in your electoral division. If there was a more recent by-election, it is the candidate who won in that by-election. You can find your current MLA by searching Elections Manitoba at the following <a href="http://www.electionsmanitoba.ca/en/Related_Links/Who_is_My_MLA.html">link</a>.</p>

<p>In Manitoba’s 2011 Election, the electoral boundaries will be different from those of the 2007 election. So depending on where you live, the electoral division in which you reside may be under a different name, and your previous MLA may be running for re-election in a different electoral division.</p>

<p>An MLA who declares themselves for re-election is called an incumbent candidate. We have a list of all the incumbent candidates on <a href="http://www.manitobaelection.ca/candidates/incumbents">this page</a>. There are fewer than 57 members on this page because some MLAs are not running for re-election.</p>

<p><a name="MLA_do"></a>
<strong>What does an MLA do?</strong></p>

<p>An MLA has several roles including proposing laws in Manitoba through what are called Bills, discussing Bills proposed by other MLAs, and voting on these Bills. An MLA also solves problems and voices concerns on behalf of members in his or her electoral division, and may work with other MLAs in the party on strategy and direction. MLAs may also serve on committees, which review the contents of proposed laws, and hear from experts and members of the public about these laws. MLAs may also be appointed by the party’s leader to take on a specific role in relation to a provincial ministry. More information is available under ‘What are the different roles that an MLA may have?’</p>

<p><a name="MLA_roles"></a>
<strong>What are the different roles that an MLA may have?</strong></p>

<p>An MLA can be a Backbencher, a House Leader, a Party Whip, a Party Leader, an Opposition Leader, an Opposition Critic, a Cabinet Minister, a Premier, or The Speaker of the House.</p>

<p><strong>Backbenchers</strong> are MLAs who are not party leaders or Cabinet Ministers. A backbencher can be a Government Backbencher if they are of the same party as that of the Government, or an Opposition Backbencher if they are of another party.</p>

<p><strong>House Leader</strong> – All the members of each political party appoint one of their MLAs to be responsible for coordinating how their political party should proceed when they gather with all 57 MLAs during the Session period, which includes law-making, questions to ministers, and debates among other things. This MLA is called the House Leader.</p>

<p><strong>The Party Whip</strong> – The Whip is the MLA within each party who is appointed with the task of ensuring that MLAs of their political party are informed of issues and attend House sessions, especially during a vote.</p>

<p><strong>The Party Leader</strong> – The Party Leader sets out the general direction of the party. The Premier and Leader of the Official Opposition are both party leaders.</p>

<p><strong>Opposition Leader</strong> – The Official Opposition is the party that wins the second highest number of seats. The Opposition Leader or ‘Leader of the Official Opposition’ is the leader of that political party.</p>

<p><strong>Opposition Critics</strong> are opposition MLAs appointed by the opposition leader to closely watch and critique a specific ministry or set of ministries. The group of opposition members who are chosen to watch and critique specific ministries are often referred to as the ‘shadow cabinet’.</p>

<p><strong>Cabinet Ministers</strong> are MLAs appointed by the Premier to oversee the day-to-day activities of government ministries and to propose new laws.</p>

<p><strong>The Premier</strong> is the party leader of the political party that wins the highest number of seats (electoral divisions) during an election. After winning an election this leader is asked to become the premier by the lieutenant governor (representative of the queen).</p>

<p><strong>The Speaker of the House</strong> is an MLA who is elected by secret ballot from all other MLAs to preserve order and enforce the “Rules of the House” during Session, which is the time when all MLAs gather to create laws, question the ministers, and engage in debates, among other things.</p>

<br/>


<p><a name="MLA_laws"></a>
<strong>How do MLAs create laws?</strong></p>

<p>MLAs have the ability to create new laws for the province. All laws they have sponsored are on public record.</p>

<p>When a law is first proposed, it is called a Bill, which has to go through several stages to become a law. Once the law is passed it is called an Act (also known as a statute). All the current Acts in Manitoba are viewable <a href="http://web2.gov.mb.ca/laws/index.php">here</a>. These are the laws that govern the province.</p>

<p>Cabinet Ministers are MLAs appointed by the premier to oversee one or more provincial departments. Cabinet Ministers can propose Government Bills, while individual MLAs can propose Private Bill. Cabinet Ministers can also create regulations under the ministries they direct, in addition to the existing Acts.</p>

<p>You can see all of the bills since 1999 on The Legislative Assembly of Manitoba website <a href="http://web2.gov.mb.ca/bills/39-5/index.php">here</a>. The bills are organized by which session of the legislature the Bills were proposed under. The sessions are the periods in which the MLAs get together to create law. At the top of the page of whichever session you choose, you can click on ‘Status of Bills’ to see which MLA sponsored each Bill.</p>

<p>The stages in passing a Bill into law are the following:</p>

<p><strong>1. Notice</strong> – A day prior to introduction</p>

<p><strong>2. First Reading</strong> – The MLA reads the bill and may give a brief explanation</p>

<p><strong>3. Second Reading</strong> – The bill gets discussed among the MLAs. The proposed Bill either gets approved in principal or rejected.</p>

<p><strong>4. Committee Stage</strong> – The Bill gets referred to a committee that has MLAs from the governing party and the opposition party or parties. These MLAs receive advice from experts and from members of the public during public hearings. The committee can then propose amendments to the Bill.</p>

<p><strong>5. Report Stage</strong> – The Bill gets reported and discussed by all of the MLAs again. The MLAs may suggest further changes.</p>

<p><strong>6. Third Reading</strong> – MLAs may suggest further changes and debate the final Bill. They can apply to have it postponed for six months, send it back to the committee, or hold a final vote on whether to pass it into law.</p>

<p><strong>7. Royal Assent</strong> – Before a Bill becomes law, it must receive approval from the Lieutenant Governor, the representative of the Queen, through what is called ‘Royal Assent’.</p>

<h2>Government Basics</h2>

<p><a name="Govt_MB"></a>
<strong>What areas of governance fall under the Manitoba government?</strong></p>

<p>The Constitution Act of 1867 grants Canadian provinces the right to govern over such areas as hospitals, charities, municipalities, shops and bars, incorporation of local businesses, local infrastructure and transportation channels, marriage, property and civil rights, natural resources and electricity, education, and other laws deemed to be  of a “local or private nature”. This is not a full list and does not include various areas that have arisen from new technologies or other such changes since 1867. Also, the Constitution Act of 1982 set out individual freedoms under the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms that cannot be taken away by any level of government.</p>

<p>Below is a list of current departments under the Manitoba government. In addition, below are some links to lists of Manitoba’s crown corporations, agencies, boards, and commissions.</p>

<strong>What is a ministry?</strong></p>

<p>A ministry is the portfolio under the direction of a Cabinet Minister, which includes departments, crown corporations, agencies, boards, commissions and other initiatives of the province, and the employees therein. Cabinet Ministers are appointed by the Premier and are responsible for the daily operations of their ministry, the creation of laws relating to their ministry, and for answering questions relating to their ministry to opposition MLAs during 'Question Period'.</p>

<p>Manitoba defines agencies, boards, and commissions as “entities established by government to carry out a range of functions and services, and include councils, authorities, advisory bodies, funding bodies, professional organizations and quasi-judicial tribunals” (Agencies, Boards and Commissions, Manitoba).</p>

<p><a name="Govt_Session"></a>
<strong>What is Session?</strong></p>

<p>A Session in the Legislature is the period of time, at least twice per year, during which all MLAs gather in the legislature and propose new laws, question the Ministers, and engage in debate among other things. A session begins with ‘The Speech from the Throne’, which is a statement on what the government has achieved and plans to do. The government’s budget is also announced during Session through the ‘Budget Speech’. The following activities occur five days per week during Session:</p>

<p><strong>Introduction of Bills</strong> – MLAs introduce new proposed laws</p>

<p><strong>Petitions</strong> – MLAs read petitions</p>

<p><strong>Committee Reports</strong> – An MLA who chairs a committee related to a Bill may report on findings</p>

<p><strong>Tabling of Reports</strong> – MLAs present reports and other documents to the House</p>

<p><strong>Ministerial Statements</strong> – Cabinet ministers may make a statement or announcement of government policy</p>

<p><strong>Oral Questions</strong> – MLAs may ask questions of the Premier and Cabinet Ministers</p>

<p><strong>Members’ Statements</strong> – MLAs may make a statement on any manner other than ministerial statements</p>

<p><strong>Grievance</strong> – MLAs may speak of a grievance</p>

<br/>


<p><a name="Govt_election"></a>
<strong>In what way does an election change the Government?</strong></p>

<p>When an election is called, all MLAs cease to hold their role as MLA. The Premier and Cabinet Ministers have to run for re-election if they wish to become MLAs again. During this period they continue to hold the roles of Premier and Cabinet Minister in order to ensure the daily operations of the government continue to be run.</p>

<p>After the election, the leader of the party with the most seats becomes the Premier. The Premier may appoint whom he/she chooses to become a Cabinet Minister, including members from another party, although this is rare. It is possible that it could be the same set of Cabinet Ministers as that of the previous government, but that is only if every one of them wins their re-election and the Premier appoints the same group of MLAs.</p>

<p>An election may also change the number of MLAs within each political party. A political party with more MLAs may give that party more votes in passing a Bill into law.</p>

<p>During an election the political parties may each produce a platform of policies and ideas that the party wishes to follow, once it is elected to form a government.</p>

<p><a name="Govt_opp"></a>
<strong>What is the Official Opposition?</strong></p>

<p>The political party whose candidates win the second highest number of seats (electoral divisions) is the Official Opposition. Its role is to question the government’s actions and policies and to offer alternatives. The Official Opposition’s leader becomes The Leader of the Official Opposition.</p>

<p>During government Session periods the ‘House Rules’ give the Official Opposition preferential status over other opposition parties. Session is the period during which MLAs create laws, opposition members can question the ministers, petitions are read, and other activities occur.</p>

<p>The Leader of the Official Opposition often appoints a ‘shadow cabinet’ of MLAs of his or her party who watch and critique specific ministries of the government and can provide alternative policies and direction.</p>

<strong>What does the Premier do?</strong></p>

<p>The Premier is the leader of the government and the person who appoints the Cabinet Ministers – usually MLAs from his or her political party who run the ministries of the government. The Premier is the Prime Minister of the province and provides leadership and direction to the government.</p>

<p>The Premier, along with other party leaders, has some special privileges during Session (the period of law-making, question period, debates, etc), such as extended speaking time during various debates in the legislature. The Premier, along with other Ministers, must answer to the opposition MLAs during the Question Period.</p>

<strong>How does a person become a Premier?</strong></p>

<p>A person may become a Premier in several ways. During an election, the leader of the political party that receives more votes than any other party becomes the Premier. If a governing party has a leadership convention, then the new leader of the party becomes Premier, so long as he or she maintains the ‘confidence of the house’. If the majority of MLAs at any time vote against ‘The Speech from the Throne’, the budget, or other certain proposed laws, then the Premier ‘loses the confidence of the house’. In this case the lieutenant governor (representative of the Queen) either dissolves government and calls an election, or selects another Premier who will maintain the confidence of the house.</p>
