<br/>


<p><a name="where"></a></p>

<h2>Where can I cast my vote?</h2>

<p>On Election Day you will be voting at a voting station in the electoral division
where you reside. Elections Manitoba provides an address look-up tool, which can show you <a href="http://electionsmanitoba.ca/2012Fortwhyte/voters/where.asp">where you will vote on Election Day</a>.</p>

<p>If you choose to participate as a voter during the advance voting period you can
choose to vote at either the Fort Whyte Returning Office (2233 McGillivray Blvd) or at the Linden Woods Community Centre (414 Lindenwood Dr W).</p>

<br/>


<p><a name="who"></a></p>

<h2>Who can I cast my vote for?</h2>

<p>If you are uncertain who you will vote for, feel free to contact your candidate,
read their answers to the questionnaire we are sending them, or read the current
news we provide for your candidate. All of this information is linked to their
candidate page.</p>

<p>Prospective candidates are candidates who are chosen to represent the various
political parties or declare themselves as independent. A candidate can be
registered in only one electoral division.</p>

<p class="small">

</p>


<p>They become official candidates after they file their nomination papers to
the ‘returning officer’ with Elections Manitoba before the close of nominations (1
PM, Aug 20th). This list is final and will not change unless a candidate withdraws
or becomes deceased.</p>

<p class="small">
Source: <a href="http://web2.gov.mb.ca/laws/statutes/ccsm/e030e.php">The Elections Act</a>
</p>


<p>Every electoral division will have one candidate who becomes MLA (the
candidate who receives the most votes). Leaders of the political parties are also
candidates to be voted upon in their electoral divisions.</p>
