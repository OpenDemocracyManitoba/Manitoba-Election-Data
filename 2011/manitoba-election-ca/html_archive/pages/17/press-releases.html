<h1>Press Releases</h1>
<p><strong>Voters and Educators Embrace Citizen-Created Manitoba Election Website</strong> - <a href="http://manitobaelection.ca/press/Manitoba_Election_ca_September_29_2011.pdf">September 29th, 2011</a> <img src="/images/pdf.png" alt="pdf" /></p>

<p>With less than a week to go before the 2011 Manitoba provincial election, the team behind Open Democracy Manitoba is busy putting the finishing touches on their citizen-created election resource. Their ManitobaElection.ca website is already a clearing-house for candidate information, but it is growing into something bigger.</p>

<p>"This all started with our own frustrations about not being able to find unbiased election information online" says Kyle Geske, one of the site’s founding members. “Our goal is to build an approachable, well-organized resource for voters. This includes gathering information about the candidates, but it also means educating voters on the election process and on politics in Manitoba” adds co-founder Jody Gillis.</p>

<p>Since the site launched, the members of Open Democracy Manitoba have been fielding questions about elections and the political process from family and friends. To answers those questions they added a voter education section to their site. Written in plain English, the material explains everything from the roles of elected officials to how constituency boundaries are created. This new feature caught the eye of a number of educators and students.</p>

<p>“The feedback we’ve received inspires us to keep adding to the site” says Ken Harasym, the member of the team responsible for graphic design. “We’ve received amazing compliments from college students, high school teachers, and university political science professors.”</p>

<p>“Our most recent feature is an interactive map that visualizes the Manitoba election results from 1958 to 2007” say Andrew Burton, another team member. “We’ve added an issue page that links to a comprehensive array of election related organizations, each trying to promote their individual issues. We also just finished posting all the candidate questionnaire responses we received back from candidates.”</p>

<p>The website is currently attracting thousands of hits each day from all over Manitoba. The Open Democracy Manitoba team is using this traffic as an opportunity to communicate important notices to voters, such as the change in electoral boundaries since the 2007 election. They want to remind all voters to double-check their constituency since the majority of boundaries have changed since the last election.</p>

<p><strong>Citizen-Created Election Website Empowers Manitoba Voters</strong> - <a href="http://manitobaelection.ca/press/Manitoba_Election_ca_September_7_2011.pdf">September 7th, 2011</a> <img src="/images/pdf.png" alt="pdf" /></p>

<p>The folks at Open Democracy Manitoba want to help you make an informed choice as a voter on October 4th. Their new election website aims to be a comprehensive resource for information on the upcoming provincial election.</p>

<p>The ManitobaElection.ca site features interactive constituency maps, a calendar of election-related events, and educational resources on legislative politics in Manitoba. Election candidates are listed along with links to their web pages, email addresses, Facebook fan pages and Twitter feeds. Online news articles that mention candidates are also linked, providing up-to-date election news from a variety of media sources.</p>

<p>The Open Democracy Manitoba community organization was founded by Winnipeggers Kyle Geske and Jody Gillis. In 2010 Geske and Gillis, instructors at Red River College, built a similar site for the Winnipeg civic election.</p>

<p>“The response to WinnipegElection.ca exceeded our expectations,” says Gillis. “By election day our site had been visited by over forty-five thousand Winnipeggers.”</p>

<p>“We’ve raised our expectations for ManitobaElection.ca”, adds Geske. “We want to engage voters and empower them to learn about the candidates, the issues, and the legislative process itself.”</p>

<p>Now that the election has officially been called, the group is working on adding historic election data to the site. They are also preparing a candidate questionnaire, which will be sent to all the candidates once nominations close on September 13th.</p>
