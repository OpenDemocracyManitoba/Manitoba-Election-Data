<h2>How are the news articles collected?</h2>

<p>Articles are automatically gathered from <a href="http://news.google.ca">Google News</a> by searching for the full names of the candidates in the upcoming Manitoba election. The search location is set to Manitoba using the <a href="http://news.google.ca/news/advanced_news_search">advanced search properties</a>.</p>

<p>If a specific news article is not showing up in our system it is because it has not been indexed by Google News. Because our news gathering is an automated process we cannot manually add news stories to a constituency or candidate page.</p>

<br/>


<p><a name="update_info"></a></p>

<h2>How can candidate information be updated?</h2>

<p>Candidates can send us updated photos and information via email: <a href="&#109;&#x61;&#105;&#108;&#116;&#111;&#x3a;&#x6d;&#97;&#x6e;&#105;&#x74;&#x6f;&#x62;&#x61;&#x2e;&#x65;&#x6c;&#101;&#x63;&#x74;&#x69;&#x6f;&#110;&#64;&#x67;&#109;&#x61;&#105;&#x6c;&#46;&#99;&#111;&#109;">&#x6d;&#97;&#x6e;&#105;&#x74;&#x6f;&#98;&#x61;&#46;&#x65;&#x6c;&#101;&#99;&#116;&#x69;&#x6f;&#x6e;&#64;&#103;&#109;&#97;&#105;&#108;&#x2e;&#99;&#111;&#109;</a></p>

<p>Emails should be sent from the email address we have listed for a candidate if possible.</p>

<p>We will do our best to process all updates within 48 hours of their receipt.</p>

<p><em>After September 2 (for the 2012 by-election) and October 2 (for the 2011 election) we will no longer be accepting candidate updates. Updates received after this date will not be posted to our site. This deadline exists to ensure that our site remains accurate and consistent during the week of the election.</em></p>

<br/>


<p><a name="candidate_info"></a></p>

<h2>How do you decide what candidate information to list?</h2>

<p><strong>Email Addresses and Phone Numbers:</strong> Found on either the political party website, the candidate's website, or on the candidate's facebook page. Phone numbers are only listed if they are for a campaign office.</p>

<p><strong>Websites:</strong> Sites have been found using Google, through the political party website, or supplied by the candidates. Sites must be election related. MLA incumbent websites are also listed on the incumbents page.</p>

<p><strong>Twitter and YouTube Accounts:</strong> Found by searching Google, twitter, youtube, the candidate's website, facebook, or supplied by the candidates.</p>

<p><strong>Photos:</strong> Found on political party websites, facebook pages, or supplied by the candidate.</p>

<p><strong>Facebook Pages:</strong> Found by searching Facebook or supplied by candidates. In most cases we will link to candidate election fan pages or profiles created specifically for the election. If no candidate page exists we will link to candidate name profiles where 1) the wall and info sections are publicly viewable, and 2) there is an indication that this individual is a candidate on either their 'wall' and/or 'info' pages. If an incumbent is using their MLA page/profile to promote their upcoming candidacy, the MLA page/profile will be used until a candidate page/profile becomes available. Private profiles will be linked to candidate only by request.</p>

<br/>


<p><a name="debates"></a></p>

<h2>How can a debate or forum be listed on your calendar?</h2>

<p>Debates and forums can be brought to our attention via email: <a href="&#109;&#97;&#105;&#x6c;&#x74;&#x6f;&#58;&#109;&#97;&#x6e;&#105;&#116;&#111;&#x62;&#x61;&#46;&#101;&#x6c;&#x65;&#x63;&#x74;&#x69;&#x6f;&#x6e;&#x40;&#x67;&#x6d;&#97;&#x69;&#x6c;&#46;&#99;&#111;&#x6d;">&#x6d;&#x61;&#110;&#x69;&#x74;&#111;&#98;&#x61;&#46;&#101;&#x6c;&#x65;&#99;&#x74;&#x69;&#x6f;&#110;&#64;&#103;&#x6d;&#x61;&#105;&#108;&#x2e;&#99;&#111;&#109;</a></p>

<br/>


<p><a name="issues"></a></p>

<h2>How are issue websites added to your <a href="/issues">issue resources page</a>?</h2>

<p>Issue websites are found using Google or are submitted by the public. If you have created or are aware of an election issue website that is not featured on our issue resources page, please bring it to our attention by emailing us at <a href="&#x6d;&#97;&#105;&#108;&#x74;&#111;&#58;&#109;&#x61;&#110;&#105;&#x74;&#x6f;&#x62;&#97;&#46;&#x65;&#x6c;&#x65;&#x63;&#x74;&#x69;&#x6f;&#110;&#x40;&#x67;&#109;&#97;&#105;&#108;&#46;&#x63;&#111;&#x6d;">&#x6d;&#x61;&#x6e;&#x69;&#x74;&#111;&#x62;&#97;&#x2e;&#101;&#x6c;&#x65;&#x63;&#116;&#105;&#111;&#x6e;&#x40;&#103;&#x6d;&#x61;&#x69;&#108;&#46;&#x63;&#111;&#109;</a>.</p>

<p>One of the following two criteria must be met in order to be listed:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The issue website was created to raise awareness about a specific issue for the 2011 Manitoba election. The issue site must mention this election directly, or the organization behind the page must have issued a media release linking the issue to this election.</p></li>
<li><p>The issue in question is specifically mentioned in the platform of any of the running parties.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>The following search criteria were used in finding issue websites:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>A search through the first ten pages of Google search results using the following search criteria: Manitoba Election 2011</p></li>
<li><p>A search through the first ten pages of Google search results using the following search criteria: Manitoba Election issues</p></li>
<li><p>A search through the first three pages of Google search results through the following search criteria: Manitoba Election 2011 (name of each topic area contained within each department name of the Manitoba government). For example, for the department ‘Manitoba Food, Agriculture and Rural Initiatives' the following searches would be made: Manitoba election 2011 food, Manitoba election 2011 agriculture, Manitoba election 2011 rural.</p></li>
</ul>


<p><em>Please note that ManitobaElection.ca will not post issue websites:</em></p>

<ul>
<li><em>That promote violence, hatred, or intolerance towards any identifiable group or person.</em></li>
<li><em>That are the product of a registered political party.</em></li>
</ul>


<br/>


<p><a name="resources"></a></p>

<h2>How can a blog or website be added to your online resources section?</h2>

<p>Email us your election related blogs or websites: <a href="&#x6d;&#x61;&#x69;&#108;&#116;&#111;&#x3a;&#x6d;&#97;&#110;&#x69;&#116;&#x6f;&#x62;&#x61;&#x2e;&#101;&#x6c;&#x65;&#x63;&#x74;&#x69;&#x6f;&#110;&#64;&#103;&#109;&#97;&#x69;&#x6c;&#x2e;&#99;&#111;&#109;">&#x6d;&#x61;&#110;&#105;&#116;&#111;&#98;&#x61;&#46;&#101;&#x6c;&#x65;&#x63;&#x74;&#x69;&#111;&#110;&#64;&#x67;&#x6d;&#97;&#105;&#x6c;&#46;&#99;&#111;&#x6d;</a></p>

<p>Our criteria is the following: A significant proportion of the blog entries, or a specific section of the blog or website, must relate to information relevent to the Manitoba provincial election. Further, the blog or website will not promote intollerance or hateful views to any identifiable group, or exist solely to promote or discredit a single candidate.</p>
